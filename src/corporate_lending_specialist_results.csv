During our early years we focused on providing solutions that supported number management and number porting. In November 2004, we expanded our product set and geographical reach with the acquisition of Tertio Telecoms Ltd. (“Evolving Systems U.K.”), a supplier of Operations Support Systems (“OSS”) software solutions for service activation and mediation to communication carriers throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. With this acquisition we not only expanded our markets beyond North America, we also added service activation and mediation solutions to our product portfolio. The acquisition significantly expanded our product and service capabilities, allowing us to address a larger portion of our customers’ OSS application needs with a balanced mix of products as well as services. We focused primarily on the wireless markets in the areas of subscriber activation, SIM card management and activation, self-service mobile applications, data enablement solutions, connected device activation and management of services. Through continued investment in developing the next generation of these products, we maintain our status in these markets and strengthen our client relationships. ﻿ Acquisitions of BLS Limited (“EVOL BLS”), four Lumata Holdings subsidiaries, Lumata France SAS, Lumata Spain S.L., Lumata UK Ltd and Lumata Deutschland GmbH (collectively, “Lumata Entities”) in 2017, along with the acquisition of RateIntegration d/b/a Sixth Sense Media (“SSM”) in 2015, expanded our footprint in the digital marketing space. Each of these acquisitions had their own platform which we still maintain today. Through the extensive work of our product development team, we have launched the Evolution platform featuring the best of these legacy platforms on cutting edge technology. Evolution is used to operate the most innovative large-scale loyalty programs, as well as providing unique mechanics enabling gamification, optimization and personalization across a variety of channels. It enables our clients to engage with their customers at all stage of their lifecycle, providing interactive dialogue and smart recommendations through all available traditional and digital channels. The platform seamlessly integrates within the service provider’s IT infrastructure, either on-premise or on a private cloud. It can be operated or managed as a service depending on the market needs. As a supplier of real-time digital engagement solutions and services, we drive growth in customer acquisition and activation, extend customer lifetime and increase customer value and revenue in the converging mobile, entertainment, financial and retail services eco-system. Our platforms, together with our team of experienced industry experts, help service providers increase their customer lifetime value (“CLV”) over the course the customer lifecycle. ﻿ Evolving Systems provides software solutions and services throughout the world. The COVID-19 global outbreak has caused instability and volatility in multiple markets where our clients conduct business. We have leveraged our ability to provide support remotely resulting in limited effect on our day-to-day operations. The inability to travel has delayed interactions with our clients on projects and in the traditional modes of sales development. We continually work with existing and new clients exploring new ways of using our products and services to enhance their business. On-going travel restrictions has caused the business to interact with clients in new ways and reduced certain costs. The long-term effects on how we conduct business in the future is still undetermined but we continue to evolve to meet client needs. ﻿ INDUSTRY DYNAMICS ﻿ The market for digital engagement to increase customer lifetime value is growing. Several key factors are driving carrier demand for next generation solutions, supporting growth for specific products within the sector: ﻿ · Growing adoption of the digital channel and changing consumer sentiment, accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, has led to growing demand for digital services enabled by telecommunication carriers, not only for end consumers, but also brands, who want to reach specific consumer audiences; · Carriers are seeking to further monetize their customer relationships and associated demographic, behavioral, location and contextual information to up-sell their network services and open new channels for optimized and personalized third-party service revenues; · Rapid adoption of smart phones and network-attached devices has resulted in increased usage of mobile data; · On-going network investment in 5G and Internet of Things (“IoT”) networks is driving increased demand...","Evolving Systems provides real-time digital engagement solutions and services to approximately 100 customers in over 60 countries worldwide.

"ITEM 1. Business Overview Model N is a leading provider of cloud revenue management solutions for life sciences and high tech companies. Our software helps companies drive mission critical business processes such as pricing, quoting, contracting, regulatory compliance, rebates and incentives. With deep industry expertise, Model N supports the complex business needs of the world’s leading brands in life sciences and high tech including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Stryker, Seagate Technology, Broadcom, and Microchip Technology. Historically, companies tended to rely on a disjointed patchwork of manual processes, spreadsheets, point applications, and legacy systems to manage their revenue processes. These processes and systems operated in isolation from one another and were labor intensive, error prone, inflexible, and costly, often resulting in missed revenue opportunities, suboptimal margins, incentive overpayments, and increased revenue compliance risk. Current industry trends, which include shortening product lifecycles, tightening compliance and regulatory controls, increasing channel complexity and growing volumes of transactional data, are causing these outdated processes and legacy systems to become increasingly ineffective. Our expertise in cloud-based revenue management solutions, combined with our knowledge of the life sciences and high tech industries, has enabled us to develop software designed to meet the unique, strategic needs of these industries, such as managed care and government pricing for life sciences companies and channel incentives management for high tech companies. Model N Revenue Cloud transforms the revenue lifecycle into a strategic, end-to-end process aligned across the enterprise. Our industry specific solution suites - Revenue Cloud for Life Sciences and Revenue Cloud for High Tech - offer a range of solutions from individual products to complete product suites. Overview of the Life Sciences and High Tech Industries The life sciences and high tech industries are large and highly fragmented. Companies in both industries market their products to a global customer base through diverse channels. Additionally, high costs are required to launch a drug or medical device to the global market. Regulatory pressures, consolidation, and other factors in both industries continue to drive a considerable focus on revenue management. Management of the revenue lifecycle is a strategic imperative and a source of competitive advantage for life sciences and high tech companies as they address increasingly globalized markets, sophisticated buyers, complex channels, and expanding volumes of data from internal and market sources. Emerging business models like outcome based pricing and service bundles further complicate the revenue management processes, which increases the need for practical solutions. Several trends specific to these industries further complicate revenue management. Life Sciences: •the emergence of large group purchasing, managed care organizations and integrated healthcare delivery networks drive increased pricing pressure, contract volume, and complexity; •increased customer and channel incentives and rebates result in the increased risk of extending unearned discounts and the overpayment of rebates; •the shift of purchasing influence from physicians to economic buyers makes price and commercial terms key decision making factors; •increased spending on healthcare by governments instead of commercial entities adds further regulatory oversight to transactions; •expanded scope of government mandates, frequency of regulatory reporting and audits, and fines, all of which increase administrative burden and monitoring costs; •increased payer-provider consolidation which makes market access harder; and •increased revenue leakage through 340B channels. High Tech: •shortened product lifecycles driving rapid pricing changes and require quick responses to quotes and competitive bidding; •increased number of core high tech products sold into different end markets with segment-specific pricing; •cyclicality and rising R&D costs contributing to a focus on maximizing sell time, margins and revenues; •increased complexity of multi-tiered global distribution channels intensifying channel conflict and price erosion; •changing financial reporting requirements due to channel complexity; and •increased use of off-invoice discounting to offset upfront discounts and mask end-customer pricing resulting in a lack of price transparency that can erode gross margins. Challenges to Effective Revenue Management Traditionally, companies addressed revenue management through a patchwork of manual processes and inflexible and costly custom solutions. This outdated approach to revenue management impedes the ability of companies to respond to changing market conditions, preventing them from maximizing revenue and increasing their revenue compliance risk. Critical challenges include: •Incomplete and unreliable information for critical strategic decisions. Legacy manual processes and systems used to manage the revenue lifecycle create silos of data causing companies to make strategic marketing, pricing and resource allocation decisions that are based on incomplete or inaccurate information. As a result, revenue strategies can be suboptimal, budgets may be misallocated, and sales and marketing efforts can fail to positively impact revenues. •Revenue leakage due to inadequate contract management and enforcement. Customer-specific contracts with complex pricing and commercial terms are common in many industries, in particular life sciences and high tech. When the commercial terms of these contracts are not automated and monitored systematically, deviations from contract pricing can occur, volume commitments can be missed, unearned discounts may be given, and revenue can be lost. •Revenue leakage due to the overpayment of incentives. life sciences and high tech companies process massive volumes of rebates and incentives. A lack of centralized, automated and enforceable processes can result in overpayment of incentives. Revenue leakage is also driven by inconsistent global pricing, poor price concession controls, and unmet contractual volume commitments. •Ineffective pricing across geographies and complex channels. Sophisticated buyers deploy global procurement strategies to discover and exploit regional and channel differences in pricing and contracting. The inability to enforce a single price for a specific sales opportunity across regions and channels can result in channel conflicts, which leads to price and revenue erosion. •Inaccurate financial reporting. Complex contracts and distribution channels have made it more difficult to obtain and process financial information, which can result in inaccurate financial reporting. For example, high tech companies face significant complexity in financial reporting and revenue recognition at the point of sale in their distribution channels. Life sciences companies have substantial challenges correctly accruing their massive rebate and incentive claim volumes. •Difficulty complying with complicated government regulations. Satisfying the regulatory requirements of numerous federal and state programs is increasingly complex for life sciences companies.

"Item 1. Business Overview Datadog is the monitoring and analytics platform for developers, IT operations teams and business users in the cloud age. Our SaaS platform integrates and automates infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, log management and security monitoring to provide unified, real-time observability of our customers’ entire technology stack. Datadog is used by organizations of all sizes and across a wide range of industries to enable digital transformation and cloud migration, drive collaboration among development, operations and business teams, accelerate time to market for applications, reduce time to problem resolution, understand user behavior and track key business metrics. Software applications are transforming how organizations engage with customers and operate their businesses. Companies across all industries are re-platforming their businesses to cloud infrastructures to enable this digital transformation. Historically, engineering teams have been siloed, making the development of next generation applications on dynamic cloud environments challenging. We started Datadog to break this model and facilitate collaboration among development and operations teams, enabling the adoption of DevOps practices. Since then we have continuously pushed to unify separate tools into an integrated monitoring and analytics platform, readily available to everyone who cares about applications and their impact on business. From our founding goal of breaking down silos between Dev and Ops, we set out in 2010 to build a real-time data integration platform to turn chaos from disparate sources into digestible and actionable insights. In 2012, we launched our first use case with infrastructure monitoring, purpose-built to handle increasingly ephemeral cloud-native architectures. This enabled us to be deployed on our customers’ entire cloud IT environments and gave our product broad usage across Dev, Ops and business teams, in turn allowing us to address a bigger set of challenges through our platform. In 2017 we launched our Application Performance Monitoring, or APM, product, designed to be broadly deployed in very distributed, micro-services architectures. In 2018, we were the first to combine the “three pillars of observability” with the introduction of our Log Management product. To allow for full-stack observability, in 2019, we launched user Experience Monitoring and Network Performance Monitoring. In 2020, we extended into security with the launch of Security Monitoring to detect threats in real time, as well as launched Continuous Profiler and Incident Management to enhance workflows and collaboration as incidents occur. Today, we offer end-to-end monitoring and analytics, powered by a common data model that is extensible for potential new use cases. Our proprietary platform combines the power of metrics, traces and logs to provide a unified view of infrastructure and application performance and the real-time events impacting this performance. Datadog is designed to be cloud agnostic and easy to deploy, with hundreds of out-of-the-box integrations, a built-in understanding of modern technology stacks and endless customizability. Customers can deploy our platform across their entire infrastructure, making it ubiquitous and a daily part of the lives of developers, operations engineers and business leaders. We believe that our platform currently addresses a significant portion of the IT Operations Management market. According to Gartner, the IT Operations Management market represents a $44 billion opportunity in 2024. We believe a large portion of this spend is for legacy on-premise and private cloud environments but does not fully include the opportunity in modern multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments. Our platform is designed to address both legacy and modern environments. We employ a land-and-expand business model centered around offering products that are easy to adopt and have a very short time to value. Our customers can expand their footprint with us on a self-service basis. Our customers often significantly increase their usage of the products they initially buy from us and expand their usage to other products we offer on our platform. We grow with our customers as they expand their workloads in the public and private cloud. Our Solution and Key Strengths Datadog was founded on the premise that the old model of siloed developers and IT operations engineers is broken, and that legacy tools used for monitoring static on-premise architectures do not work in modern cloud or hybrid environments. Datadog’s cloud-native platform enables development and operations teams to collaborate, quickly build and improve applications, and drive business performance. Empowered by our out-of-the box functionality and simple, self-service installation, our customers are able to rapidly deploy our platform to provide application- and infrastructure-wide visibility, often within minutes. • Built for dynamic cloud infrastructures. Our innovative platform was born in the cloud and was built to work with ephemeral cloud technologies such as microservices, containers and serverless computing. Our data model was built to work at cloud scale with highly dynamic data sets and processes more than 10 trillion events a day. • Simple but not simplistic. Our platform is easy-to-use with out-of-the-box integrations, customizable drag-and-drop dashboards, real-time visualization and prioritized alerting. The platform is deployed in a self-service installation process within minutes, allowing new users to quickly derive value without any specialized training or heavy implementation or customization. It is highly extensible across a wide array of use cases to a broad set of developers, operations engineers and business users. As a result, our platform is integral to business operations and used every day, and our users find increasing value in the solution over time. • Integrated data platform. We were the first to combine the “three pillars of observability” - metrics, traces, and logs - with the introduction of our log management solution in 2018. Today, our platform combines infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, log management, user experience monitoring, and network performance monitoring in one integrated data platform. This approach increases efficiency by reducing both the expense and friction of attempting to glean insights from disparate systems. We are able to provide a unified view across the IT stack, including infrastructure and application performance, as well as the real-time events impacting performance. Each of our products is integrated and taken together provide the ability to view metrics, traces and logs side-by-side and perform correlation analysis. • Built for collaboration.

Our technology publishes more than one billion remediations daily, and our solution is trusted by some of the largest and most influential companies in the world, including ADP, Tommy Hilfiger, 360 Media, Samsung, Darden, Landry’s and more. Government agencies, from the federal level down to the local level, have also integrated our software in their digital platforms, including the Federal Communications Commission and the Social Security Administration. Industry Background If not coded properly, a website or application may not offer full access to content or functionality for individuals with disabilities and, in particular, for users of assistive technology (“AT”), such as a screen reader. As a result, those sites may exclude potential users and customers. As discussed in more detail below, these sites also may not comply with U.S. and foreign laws requiring accessibility and digital inclusion, such as Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, and California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act. Website accessibility lawsuits have continued to increase in recent years. By some estimates, more than 3,000 lawsuits were filed in federal and state courts in 2020. Traditional solutions addressing web accessibility may be costly and difficult to implement. Historically, the process for achieving compliance has been driven by costly consulting services and has not fully utilized emerging technologies to reduce the compliance cost burden. At the same time, web accessibility efforts have generally focused on a limited number of disability use cases, leaving many users’ accessibility needs for digital inclusion unaddressed. Businesses may have been reluctant to invest further in web accessibility solutions due to a perceived lack of commercial return on the significant investment required to design and implement a thorough and usable compliance solution. Other solutions have been developed to help users access websites, but these often require the installation of a plug-in or software on the user’s computer. Similarly, some are tailored to either single or a limited number of use cases and do not encompass a more holistic approach for addressing compliance and accessibility. AudioEye Solutions At its core, AudioEye’s provides an always-on testing, remediation, and monitoring solution that continually improves conformance with WCAG. This in turn helps businesses and organizations comply with WCAG standards as well as applicable U.S. and foreign accessibility laws. Our technology is capable of immediately identifying and fixing common accessibility errors and addresses a wide range of disabilities including dyslexia, color blindness, epilepsy and more. AudioEye also offers additional solutions to provide for enhanced compliance and accessibility including periodic manual auditing, manual remediations and legal support services. Our solutions may be purchased through a subscription service on a month-to-month basis or with one or multi-year terms. We also offer PDF remediation services and Native Mobile App audit reports to help our customers with their digital accessibility needs. AudioEye Customers Our current and potential customer base includes a very broad range of private and public sector customers, including: · Small- and medium-sized businesses; · Corporate enterprises; · Non-profit organizations; · Federal government agencies, whose electronic and information technology must be accessible to people with disabilities, including employees and members of the public, pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and · Foreign, state and local governments and agencies, which often have laws and regulations that require accessibility for people with disabilities. AudioEye Channels / Go-to-market: We go-to-market through two primary channels: Enterprise and Partner and Marketplace.

"Item 1. Business. Overview Appian Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, ""Appian,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" or ""our"") provides a low-code automation platform that accelerates the creation of high-impact business applications and workflows, enabling our customers to automate the most important aspects of their business. Global organizations use our applications to improve customer experience, achieve operational excellence, and simplify global risk management and compliance. With our platform, organizations can rapidly and easily design, build, and implement powerful, enterprise-grade custom applications through our intuitive, visual interface with little or no coding required. Our customers have used applications built on our platform to launch new business lines, automate vital employee workflows, manage complex trading platforms, accelerate drug development, and build global procurement systems. With our platform, decision makers can reimagine their products, services, processes, and customer interactions by removing much of the complexity and many of the challenges associated with traditional approaches to software development. Organizations across all industries are digitally transforming by leveraging software to automate and optimize mission critical operations, enhance customer experiences, and drive competitive differentiation. Historically, organizations have principally relied on packaged software and custom software solutions to operationalize and automate their businesses. Packaged software often fails to address unusual use cases or to enable differentiation and requires organizations to adapt their individual processes, needs, and systems of record to standardized frameworks. While traditional custom software solutions can be differentiated and tailored to meet strategic objectives, development requires a long, iterative, and cumbersome process, as well as costly integration, and relies on scarce developer talent. We enable organizations to differentiate themselves from their competition through software-enabled digital transformation. Our low-code automation platform employs an intuitive, visual interface and pre-built development modules that reduce the time required to build powerful and unique applications. Our platform automates the creation of forms, workflows, data structures, reports, and other software elements that would otherwise need to be manually coded. This functionality greatly reduces the iterative development process, allowing for real-time optimization and ultimately shortening the time it takes to design, build, and deploy applications. Our customers take advantage of our complete automation capabilities, including our industry-leading workflow engine, rules engine, native Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, capabilities, leading case management capabilities, and integrated Google-based artificial intelligence, or AI. Our customers can leverage these technologies to apply the right automation approach for each specific use case. Further, our patented Self-Assembling Interface Layer, or SAIL, technology ensures applications developed on our platform can be immediately and natively deployed across a full range of mobile and desktop devices with no additional customization, including desktop web browsers, tablets, and mobile phones. Updates to applications developed with SAIL disseminate automatically across device types to ensure all users benefit from the most up-to-date functionality. At the same time, we unify enterprise data in a single searchable environment, providing organizations with a comprehensive view of customer, product, organizational asset, and other critical information. Rich reporting dashboards capture detailed performance metrics, providing valuable business intelligence and analytics that enable business process optimization. Our platform can be deployed in the cloud or on-premises, with organizations able to access the same functionality and data sources in all cases. Our go-to-market strategy consists of both direct sales and sales through strategic partners. We sell our software almost exclusively through subscriptions and intend to grow our revenue both by adding new customers and increasing the number of users at existing customers that use our applications or increase the number of applications developed on our platform. Strategic partners work with organizations undergoing digital transformations projects and, when these partners recognize an opportunity for our platform, they often introduce us to potential customers. Many of our customers begin by building a single application and grow to build dozens of applications on our platform, which implicitly reduces the per-user cost of each application. Generally, the development of new applications results in the expansion of our user base within an organization and a corresponding increase in revenue to us because we charge subscription fees on a per-user basis and, to a lesser degree, non-user based single application licenses. Every additional application an organization creates on our platform increases the value of our platform for that organization because it further integrates people, processes, and data across the organization and facilitates knowledge sharing. At the same time, our industry-leading Customer Success organization enables our customers to more easily build and deploy applications on our platform to achieve their digital transformation goals. We have experienced strong revenue growth, with revenue of $304.6 million, $260.4 million, and $226.7 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our subscriptions revenue was $198.7 million, $151.3 million, and $126.0 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and includes sales of our software-as-a-service, or SaaS, subscriptions, on-premises term license subscriptions, and maintenance and support. SaaS subscription revenue, which is also referred to as cloud subscription revenue, was $129.2 million, $95.0 million, and $67.4 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, representing year-over-year growth rates of 36% from 2019 to 2020 and 41% from 2018 to 2019. Our professional services revenue, generated by our Customer Success organization, was $105.9 million, $109.1 million, and $100.7 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Over time, as the need for professional services associated with user deployments decreases and the number of end users increases, we expect subscriptions revenue as a percentage of total revenue will continue to increase. Further, as the usage of partners expands, we expect the proportion of our total revenue from subscriptions to increase over time. We have invested in developing our platform, expanding our sales and marketing and research and development capabilities, and providing general and administrative resources to support our growth. We intend to continue to invest in our business to take advantage of our market opportunity. As a result, we incurred net losses of $33.5 million, $50.7 million, and $49.5 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We also used cash in operations of $7.6 million, $8.9 million, and $31.3 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018,...","Appian Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, ""Appian,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" or ""our"") provides a low-code automation platform that accelerates the creation of high-impact business applications and workflows, enabling our customers to automate the most important aspects of their business.

"Item 1. Business Overview Oblong, Inc. (“Oblong” or “we” or “us” or the “Company”) was formed as a Delaware corporation in May 2000 and is a provider of patented multi-stream collaboration technologies and managed services for video collaboration and network applications. Prior to March 6, 2020, Oblong, Inc. was named Glowpoint, Inc. (“Glowpoint”). On October 1, 2019, the Company closed an acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Oblong Industries, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation founded in 2006 (“Oblong Industries”), pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Oblong Industries became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). See further discussion of the Merger in Note 3 - Oblong Industries Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. On March 6, 2020, Glowpoint changed its name to Oblong, Inc. In this Report, we use the terms “Oblong” or “we” or “us” or the “Company” to refer to (i) Oblong (formerly Glowpoint), for periods prior to the closing of the Merger, and (ii) the “combined organization” of Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) and Oblong Industries for periods after the closing of the Merger. For purposes of segment reporting, we refer to the Oblong (former Glowpoint) business as “Glowpoint” herein, and to the Oblong Industries business as “Oblong Industries” herein. We believe there is a substantial market opportunity for Oblong Industries’ product offerings and services. Therefore, we expect to focus our future investments in product development and sales and marketing on our efforts to grow revenue from Oblong Industries’ products and service offerings. Glowpoint’s business has experienced revenue declines in recent years which we expect to continue. We plan to seek opportunities in the future to divest some or all of Glowpoint’s business. Recent Developments On February 1, 2021, we determined to voluntarily withdraw the listing of the Company’s common stock from the NYSE American Stock Exchange (the “NYSE American”) and transfer such listing to The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). The listing and trading of our common stock on the NYSE American ended on February 11, 2021, and began trading on Nasdaq on February 12, 2021. The terms of the Company’s Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (together, the “Series D and E Preferred Stock”), provided that such shares were automatically convertible into a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the accrued value of the preferred shares (initially $28.50), plus any accrued dividends thereon, divided by the conversion price (initially $2.85 per share, subject to specified adjustments) upon the completion of both (i) approval of such conversion by the Company’s stockholders entitled to vote thereon (which occurred on December 19, 2019); and (ii) the receipt of all required authorizations and approval of a new listing application for the combined organization following the Company’s October 2019 acquisition of Oblong Industries from the NYSE American or any such other exchange upon which the Company’s securities are then listed for trading. This conversion condition was completed in its entirety, and the Series D and E Preferred Stock automatically converted to shares of common stock pursuant to their terms, effective upon the commencement of trading of the common stock on Nasdaq in February 2021 as described above. Following the conversion of the Series D and E Preferred Stock during February 2021, the Company had issued and outstanding no shares of Preferred Stock.

We believe this is significantly higher adoption than other experience management solutions available in the market. We offer our platform through a SaaS business model. We use a “land-and-expand” model, whereby once customers have deployed our platform, they often increase the number of end-users through expansion to additional business units and geographies, and they also purchase more modules. We focus our selling efforts on both business leaders who are often making a strategic purchase of our platform with the potential for broad use throughout their enterprises, as well as functional leaders purchasing for their teams. We price our subscriptions based on the functionality and capacity needs of our customers.

Leaders across industries rely on the Anaplan platform-powered by our proprietary Hyperblock® technology-to connect teams, systems, and insights from across their organizations to continuously adapt to change, transform how they operate, and reinvent value creation. The Anaplan platform enables businesses to be more agile, make better decisions and to plan and execute their ongoing digital transformation to compete in today’s digital economy. Our cloud platform empowers enterprises to orchestrate complex scenario planning and conduct continuous forecasting to systematically identify possibilities, seize opportunities, and reduce risk. Users of our platform can view and assess the impact of assumptions on plans and key performance indicators in real time and across multiple business dimensions. Powered by our proprietary Hyperblock® technology, our platform’s in-memory data storage and calculation capabilities deliver calculations on a massive amount of data in real time and provide a single source of information for planning, ensuring the consistency, quality, and integrity of the data utilized. Our platform also allows customers to leverage intelligent forecasting capabilities backed by machine learning to understand future market drivers, analyze the impact of hypothetical planning scenarios, and quickly pinpoint accurate forecasts. Customers can harness actionable intelligence from these predictive tools that may help them achieve a competitive advantage. Our platform’s multi-dimensional modeling features enable our customers to plan with large data sets that integrate internal historical data with external market-driven data to derive finely tuned forecasts. These modeling capabilities provide the flexibility our customers need to plan at enterprise scale and improve decision-making across their enterprises with any number of users. Our platform puts the power of planning directly in the hands of its users with agile collaboration tools, and a highly responsive and secure user experience that spans across devices, personalized views and reporting. The dynamic structure of our platform allows enterprises to break down traditional silos across the planning processes in ways that can improve decision-making and generate transformative business value. We put the success of our customers at the center of our culture, strategy, and investments. As a leader in Connected Planning that enables digital transformation initiatives, we have deep domain expertise and have developed a robust Connected Planning ecosystem to enable our customers to more effectively unlock the potential of our platform. Our Connected Planning ecosystem includes skilled Anaplan users and dedicated professionals from Certified Model Builders and Solution Architects to Certified Master Anaplanners, spread throughout both our customer and partner communities. This ecosystem continues to grow organically as demand for our platform grows and our customers and partners encourage their users to enhance their Anaplan expertise. By aligning our thought leadership, Connected Planning ecosystem, worldwide development and delivery capabilities, and local sales and service resources, our Customer First strategy drives exceptional value throughout our customers’ Connected Planning and digital transformation journeys. We view our Customer First strategy as core to capturing our Connected Planning vision and driving continued expansion in the use of our platform. Our customers often initially adopt our platform within a specific business function for one or more planning use cases, but also because our platform has the potential to be used as an enterprise-wide integrated planning and forecasting tool and as part of a broader digital transformation initiative. We use a “land and expand” sales strategy to capitalize on this potential. Once customers see the benefits of our platform for their initial use cases, they often increase the number of users, add new use cases, and expand to additional lines of business, divisions, and geographies. We call this the Honeycomb™ effect. This expansion often generates a natural network effect in which the value of our platform to customers increases as more use cases are adopted, more users are connected, and greater amounts of data are incorporated in our platform. As of January 31, 2021, over 1,600 customers were using our platform. The success of our “land and expand” strategy is validated by the expansion we have experienced in the use of our platform by our largest customers and by our dollar-based net expansion rates. Our top 25 customers by average annual recurring revenue as of January 31, 2021, had average annual recurring revenue of approximately $4.2 million, compared to the average annual recurring revenue represented by their initial purchase of approximately $0.4 million. In addition, our annual dollar-based net expansion rate for Anaplan was 114%, 122% and 123% at the end of fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a description of how we calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate. The number of customers with greater than $250,000 of annual recurring revenue was 453, 353, and 248 as of the end of fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We monitor this metric, and believe it is a useful tool to investors, as an indicator of the scale of customer adoption and expansion of our platform. While achieving and maintaining incremental sales to existing customers requires increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts, we believe the introduction of new solutions, features and functionality to our platform, and customers realizing benefits through their initial adoption of our platform, means we have significant opportunities to further expand the use of our platform by our existing customers as well as to attract additional customers. We have a robust partner ecosystem that includes strategic consulting, systems integration, and technology firms. Our strategic consulting and systems integration partners are an essential part of our go-to-market strategy. These partners promote our platform as their clients examine how to plan more effectively or seek digital transformation through organizational change or improved business processes.

"Item 1. Business Overview Our mission is to transform financial services through innovation, reputation and speed. nCino is a leading global provider of cloud-based software for financial institutions. We empower banks and credit unions with the technology they need to meet ever-changing client expectations and regulatory requirements, gain increased visibility into their operations and performance, replace legacy systems, and operate digitally and more competitively. Our solution, the nCino Bank Operating System®, digitizes, automates, and streamlines inefficient and complex processes and workflow and utilizes data analytics and artificial intelligence and machine learning (""AI/ML"") to enable financial institutions to more effectively onboard new clients, make loans and manage the entire loan life cycle, open deposit and other accounts, and manage regulatory compliance. We serve financial institution customers of all sizes and complexities, including global financial institutions, enterprise banks, regional banks, community banks, credit unions, and new market entrants, such as challenger banks. Our customers deploy and utilize our digital platform, which can be accessed anytime, anywhere and from any internet-enabled device, for mission critical functions across their organizations. Built as a single, multi-tenant SaaS platform, the nCino Bank Operating System transforms the way financial institutions operate, go to market, and interact with their clients, while delivering measurable return on investment by enabling them to: •digitally serve their clients across commercial, small business, and retail lines of business, •improve financial results, •operate more efficiently, •manage risk and compliance more effectively, and •establish a data, audit, and business intelligence hub. We were founded in a bank with the goal of improving that institution’s operations and client service. Realizing the problems we were addressing were endemic to virtually all banks and credit unions, we were spun out as a separate company in late 2011 with the vision of providing a comprehensive solution to onboard clients, originate any type of loan and open any type of account on a single cloud-based platform. We initially focused the nCino Bank Operating System on transforming commercial and small business lending for community and regional banks. We introduced our solution to enterprise banks in the United States in 2014, and then internationally in 2017, and have subsequently expanded across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific (""APAC""). Throughout this market expansion, we broadened our solution by adding functionality for retail lending, client onboarding, deposit account opening, analytics and AI/ML. Our holistic solution enables us to provide a single digital banking platform for financial institutions of all sizes on a global basis. We work with some of the world’s leading SIs to help implement our solution, which has increased our capacity to deliver and deploy the nCino Bank Operating System and enabled us to scale more quickly. As a native cloud platform that utilizes a single code base regardless of the size and complexity of the financial institution, the nCino Bank Operating System is highly scalable and configurable for the specific needs of each of our customers. Once implemented, our solution becomes deeply embedded in our customers’ business processes, enabling mission critical workflow across the financial institution on a single platform and allowing our customers to serve their clients without locality or access constraints. The nCino Bank Operating System connects the front, middle, and back office employees of a financial institution with clients and third parties across lines of business. We deliver data analytics and AI/ML capabilities through our nCino IQ (""nIQ"") application suite to provide our customers with automation and insights into their operations, such as tools for analyzing, measuring, and managing credit risk, as well as to improve their ability to comply with regulatory requirements. Fundamental elements of the nCino Bank Operating System are built on the Salesforce platform (the ""Salesforce Platform""), which allows us to focus our product development efforts on building deep vertical functionality specifically for banks and credit unions while leveraging the Salesforce Platform’s global infrastructure, reliability, and scalability. We offer the nCino Bank Operating System on a subscription basis pursuant to non-cancellable multi-year contracts that typically range from three to five years, and we employ a “land and expand” business model. Our initial deployment with a customer generally focuses on implementing a client onboarding, loan origination, and/or deposit account opening application in a specific line of business within the financial institution, such as commercial, small business, or retail. The nCino Bank Operating System is designed to scale with our customers and once our solution is deployed, we seek to have our customers expand adoption within and across lines of business. The nCino Bank Operating System leverages common data sets and functionality across applications, which optimizes and accelerates the deployment of our solution throughout a financial institution. Our business has achieved rapid growth since its inception. We plan to continue investing in expanding the breadth and depth of the nCino Bank Operating System and expanding internationally. We believe our product development and global expansion initiatives will continue to drive revenue and customer growth. Our total revenues were $91.5 million, $138.2 million, and $204.3 million for fiscal 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, representing a 49.4% compound annual growth rate. We also had recurring, subscription-based revenues of $64.5 million, $103.3 million, and $162.4 million for fiscal 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, representing a 58.7% compound annual growth rate.

"Item 1. BUSINESS General Providing software solutions that empower wireless carriers and cable service providers to simplify and enhance the user experience of mobile consumers around the world is a mission that Smith Micro pursues with passion. By providing mobile apps for digital family safety, carrier-grade voice messaging platforms and smart retail solutions, Smith Micro assists its carrier customers with building stronger, more profitable relationships with their mobile subscribers. Our solution portfolio is comprised of proven products that enable our customers to provide: • In-demand digital services that connect today’s digital lifestyle, including family location services, parental controls, and consumer IoT devices to mobile consumers worldwide; • Easy visual access to voice messages on mobile devices through visual voicemail and voice-to-text transcription functionality; and • Strategic, consistent and measurable digital demo experiences that educate retail shoppers, create awareness of products and services and drive in-store sales, and optimize retail experiences with actionable analytics derived from in-store customer behavior. We continue to innovate and evolve our business case in response to industry trends in order to capitalize upon growth opportunities in emerging markets, such as digital lifestyle services and online family safety, “Big Data” analytics, automotive telematics, and the consumer IoT marketplace. The key to our longevity, however, is not simply technological innovation, but our customer-first approach to doing business. Despite the global headwinds caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and significant investment in headcount additions, Smith Micro continued to thrive in 2020 as the business remained profitable and generated $7.9 million in cash from operations. To solidify our position as a leading white-label solution provider in the family safety market, we purchased the operator business of Circle Media Labs Inc. (“Circle”) - an acquisition that included multiple customer contracts and a perpetual source code license to Circle’s robust parental control software. Our development team spent the majority of 2020 integrating these features into our SafePath® platform, which enabled us to unveil the most comprehensive family safety offering on the market for wireless carriers in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. The Company was incorporated in California in November 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 5800 Corporate Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15237 and our telephone number is (412) 837-5300.

Information contained on our website does not constitute a part of this Report. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “SMSI.” Business Segments We currently have one reportable operating segment: Wireless. The wireless industry continues to undergo rapid change on all fronts as connected devices, mobile applications, and digital content are consumed by users who want information, high-speed wireless connectivity and entertainment, anytime, anywhere. While most of us think about being “connected” in terms of computers, tablets and smartphones, the consumer IoT market is creating a world where almost anything can be connected to the wireless internet. Wearable devices such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, pet trackers and GPS locators, as well as smart home devices, are now commonplace, enabling people, pets and things to be connected to the “Internet of Everything.” These devices have created an entire ecosystem of over-the-top (“OTT”) apps, while expanding how communication service providers can provide value to mobile consumers. Although there are numerous business opportunities associated with pervasive connectivity, there are also numerous challenges, including: • The average age by which most children use smartphones and other connected devices continues to decrease. As such, parents and guardians must be proactive in managing and combating digital lifestyle issues such as excessive screen time, cyberbullying, and online safety; • Complexity, congestion, and spectrum scarcity plague wireless networks, making it difficult and expensive to satisfy the demand for mobile services by consumers and businesses; • As IoT use cases continue to proliferate and scale, management complexity, security and interoperability must be addressed efficiently and correctly; • Mobile network operators (“MNOs”) are being marginalized by messaging applications, and face growing competitive pressure from cable multiple system operators (“MSOs”) and others deploying Wi-Fi networks to attract mobile users; • Enterprises face increasing pressure to mobilize workforces, operations, and customer engagement, but lack the expertise and technologies needed to leverage mobile technology securely and cost-effectively; and • Consumers seek simpler network access and more personalized mobile experiences, while simultaneously demanding faster, cheaper, and more secure wireless services. To address these challenges, Smith Micro offers the multi-platform, modular solutions below. Products SafePath® - Comprised of SafePath Family, SafePath IoT, and SafePath Home, the SafePath product suite provides comprehensive and easy-to-use tools to protect digital lifestyles and manage connected devices both inside and outside the home. As a carrier-grade, white-label platform, SafePath empowers wireless service providers and cable operators to bring to market full-featured, on-brand family safety solutions that provide in-demand services to mobile subscribers such as location tracking, parental controls, and driver safety functionality. Delivered to end-users as value-added services, SafePath-based solutions activate new revenue streams for wireless service providers while helping to increase brand affinity and reduce subscriber churn.

"ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview We are a leading global provider of connected fleet and mobile asset solutions delivered as Software as a Service (“SaaS”). Our solutions deliver a measurable return by enabling our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in commercial fleets or personal vehicles. We generate actionable insights that enable a wide range of customers, from large enterprise fleets to small fleet operators and consumers, to reduce fuel and other operating costs, improve efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, enhance driver safety, manage risk and mitigate theft. Our solutions mostly rely on our proprietary, highly scalable technology platforms, which allow us to collect, analyze and deliver information based on data from our customers’ vehicles. Using an intuitive, web-based interface, dashboards or mobile apps, our fleet customers can access large volumes of real-time and historical data, monitor the location and status of their drivers and vehicles and analyze a wide number of key metrics across their fleet operations. We have a large global presence, with vehicle subscriptions in over 120 countries across six continents. We currently serve a highly diverse customer base, including 4,800 fleet operators, which represented 70% of our subscription revenue for fiscal year 2021. We target sales of our enterprise fleet management solutions to customers who desire a premium solution, generally for large fleets, which we define as fleets of 50 or more vehicles. Large fleets accounted for over 86% of our fleet subscriptions at March 31, 2021. We believe we have a satisfied customer base and, among our more than 950 large fleet operator customers, we experienced an annual customer retention rate of 94% in fiscal year 2021. In addition, for large fleets with 500 or more vehicles, we experienced an annual customer retention rate in excess of 98% in fiscal year 2021. We have multinational enterprise fleet customer deployments with companies such as Baker Hughes, BP, Chevron, DHL, G4S, Halliburton, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Schlumberger, Shell, The Linde Group, Total and Weatherford. We also offer a range of subscription-based fleet and vehicle management solutions to meet the needs and price points of small fleet operators and consumers. Our safety and security features, including driver performance and vehicle monitoring, are important attributes of our solutions for these customers. With the exception of fiscal year 2021, we have consistently grown our customer base. As evidence of this growth, subscribers, one of our key operating metrics and a factor influencing our rate of subscription revenue growth, increased at a compound annual growth rate of 9.5% from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2021, and as of March 31, 2021, we tracked and managed over 744,000 subscribers. As a further indicator of our scale, in fiscal year 2021, we collected data on approximately 137 million trips per month and recorded approximately 9 billion vehicle positions per month. The monthly price charged per subscriber varies among our customers depending on the services and features they require, hardware options, customer size, route to market and geographic location of the customer. Consequently, our rate of subscription revenue growth is influenced by not only the rate of growth in the number of subscribers but also by the evolving mix of our subscriber base. The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus and the various efforts to contain the spread resulted in a prolonged slowdown of global economic activity. In fiscal 2021, this impacted demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including from many of our customers, while also disrupting sales cycles, marketing activities and supply chains for an extended period of time. This has had an adverse impact on our sales and operations, largely affecting the consumer, passenger transport and oil and gas verticals. Conversely, as we service a broad range of clients across diverse industries, some are experiencing an increased demand from their customers. Recognizing the uncertainty of the market, we continue to proactively monitor the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business. Despite the significant reduction in vehicle movements across many industries during the government imposed ‘lockdowns’ across our various geographies, we have continued to provide our full range of solutions and premium service to many of our customers across a number of industries who continued to operate due to them being deemed essential service providers. During this pandemic, our solutions have been integral in helping these businesses enhance the quality of their services by increasing safety, efficiency and enabling optimized use of their fleets. In addition, a significant portion of our employees worldwide have worked remotely for an extended period of time, and while we have gradually started to re-open facilities with appropriate social distancing and health practices when and as permitted by local governmental authorities, we are allowing some employees to work from home for the foreseeable future. Industry Overview Challenges Facing Fleet Operators Worldwide Fleet managers operate in an increasingly competitive and highly regulated global environment. Timely and accurate decision-making enabled by solutions that provide real-time visibility into vehicle location and driver performance is critical to managing a safe, efficient fleet. In some developing areas of the world, ensuring driver and vehicle safety and security is also particularly challenging given high crime rates, which have resulted in automotive insurance mandates and regulatory requirements for vehicle tracking. Consequently, fleet managers and consumers demand solutions that promote driver and passenger safety, mitigate risk, drive operational efficiencies, improve security and reduce automotive insurance costs. The business environment for fleet managers is further complicated by the large number of transportation-related regulatory and compliance requirements worldwide, and the frequency with which rules and regulations change. Legacy fleet management solutions inadequately address industry needs as many businesses use discrete manual processes, such as spreadsheet and paper-based systems and telephones, to monitor vehicle and driver activity. These approaches are labor intensive, prone to error, do not provide continuous monitoring of fleets, make it difficult to optimize fleet utilization, manage operating costs and generate minimal business intelligence. Additionally, legacy fleet management technology frequently provides limited functionality beyond basic location-based tracking and makes it difficult...","We are a leading global provider of connected fleet and mobile asset solutions delivered as Software as a Service (“SaaS”).

"Item 1. BUSINESS Overview. Teradata Corporation (""we,"" ""us,"" ""Teradata,"" or the ""Company"") is a multi-cloud enterprise data warehouse platform provider focused on helping companies leverage all their data across an enterprise to uncover real-time intelligence, at scale. In doing so, we help companies to find answers to their toughest business challenges. All efforts we perform are in support of our purpose of transforming how businesses work and people live through the power of data. Teradata has broadened its market opportunity by evolving from an on-premises only, enterprise data warehouse company to a multi-cloud, enterprise data warehouse platform provider. We help our customers integrate and simplify their data and analytics ecosystem, streamline access and management of data, and use analytics to derive business value from diverse data types. Our target market focuses on organizations that are the world's most demanding, large-scale users of data. The largest companies in the world have spent decades building mission-critical, complex, and large-scale on-premises data environments. However, these companies face significant challenges from ecosystems that have grown over time, including siloed data and conflicting and duplicative solutions, resulting in environments that are highly complex and expensive to maintain and manage. Despite these companies investing heavily in technology, people, and infrastructure, their employees are unable to effectively access the data they need to efficiently run their businesses or activate data to make intelligent and innovative business decisions. In addition, most of these organizations are also experiencing a dramatic increase in data volumes and complexity due to digital transformation. As companies seek greater agility and flexibility demanded by today’s digitalized and highly disruptive economy, they are turning to cloud infrastructures. By accessing a data warehouse platform integrated within a cloud-based ecosystem, companies can flexibly access and pay for capabilities on demand integrated with the elasticity of cloud. This provides companies the ability to deploy projects and initiatives, with agility and as needed. Given the petabytes of data and the millions of queries executed daily on-premises, we know that the journey to cloud will be a significant endeavor for our customers leading to ecosystems spanning on-premises and cloud for the foreseeable future. With companies pivoting to invest in the cloud, we believe it is essential for these businesses to be able to integrate ecosystems across on-premises and across multi-cloud environments, simplify access to data wherever it resides and accommodate analytics at massive scale and speed. As a result, we believe that the market for our solutions and services is large and growing. Our solution, Teradata Vantage™, is our data warehouse platform that allows companies to leverage all of their data across an enterprise, whether in public or private clouds, on-premises, or in a multi-cloud environment. It connects multiple sources of data to drive ecosystem simplification, delivers multi-dimensional scale and integration, and it supports customers on their journey to cloud through an integrated migration. Teradata is a leader in enabling the migration of a company's data to a cloud based ecosystem by running the same software platform in all deployments (on-premises or public cloud), providing software license portability, data and workload automation tools, as well as associated services. Teradata Vantage also contains a secure, highly concurrent and resilient analytics engine that addresses the scalability demands of our target market, the largest companies in the world. Vantage is an open platform offering full integration of datasets, tools, analytical languages and functions within one platform, including leading commercial and open source technologies. Teradata has also made it easier for customers to purchase our solution via subscription offerings, and flexible, ""pay for what you use"" consumption pricing. These combined capabilities enable companies to reduce complexity, risk, and cost, while leveraging data as an asset in solving their business challenges and driving business outcomes, which can include, among other things: •Improving customer experience and profitability, •Improving operational efficiency, •Driving financial transformation with accurate and timely data, •Creating a single integrated view of customers across digital and physical channels, and •Creating more efficient utilization of assets through machine learning of sensor data. Our business consulting services include a broad range of offerings, including support for organizations to establish a data and analytics vision, enable a multi-cloud ecosystem architecture and identify and operationalize analytical opportunities to ensure their ecosystem investments deliver significant value. In addition, we offer robust support and maintenance services for our offerings. Teradata operates from numerous locations within the United States with the primary locations being San Diego, California, and Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, we have sales, services, research and development, and administrative offices located in 35 countries. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2020, we had total revenues of $1.836 billion, of which approximately 56% was derived from the Americas region (North America and Latin America) and 44% from the International regions (Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Japan). For financial information about our segments and geographic information, see ""Note 14-Segment, Other Supplemental Information and Concentrations"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report. History. Teradata originated as a startup in a garage in Brentwood, California, and was incorporated in 1979 as a Delaware corporation, driven by the need for robust computing power to harness the value of aggregated data. In 1991, Teradata was acquired and operated as a division until it was spun off as an independent, publicly-traded company named Teradata Corporation (NYSE: TDC) on September 30, 2007. Industry and Market Opportunity. Our view is that data and analytics continue to be a management priority for industry-leading companies. We believe that companies are facing significant ongoing increases in data volumes and proliferation of data silos. Furthermore, the agility provided by cloud-based technologies provides significant benefit, but also creates additional complexity, with the rise of and ecosystems that must span multiple cloud and on-premises environments. These factors all contribute to the increased complexity, cost, and risk associated with managing data and analytic environments. This is particularly true for our target market of global enterprise companies, and we believe that these companies require tightly integrated solutions that...","Teradata Corporation (""we,"" ""us,"" ""Teradata,"" or the ""Company"") is a multi-cloud enterprise data warehouse platform provider focused on helping companies leverage all their data across an enterprise to uncover real-time intelligence, at scale.

"Item 1. Business Overview Zuora provides a cloud-based subscription management platform, architected specifically for dynamic, recurring business models. Our solution enables companies across multiple industries and geographies to launch, manage and scale a subscription business, automating the entire subscription order-to-revenue process, including billing, collections and revenue recognition. With Zuora’s solution, businesses can change pricing and packaging for products and services to grow and scale, efficiently comply with revenue recognition standards, analyze customer data to optimize their subscription offerings, and build meaningful relationships with their subscribers. Many of today’s enterprise software systems manage their order-to-revenue processes using software built for a product driven economy. These systems were not designed for the dynamic, ongoing nature of subscription services and can be extremely difficult to configure. In traditional product-based businesses, order-to-revenue was a linear process-a customer orders a product, is billed for that product, payment is collected, and the revenue is recognized. These legacy product-based systems were not specifically designed to handle the complexities and ongoing customer events of recurring relationships, commonly found in a subscription business, and their impact on areas such as billing proration, revenue recognition, and reporting in real-time. Using product-based software to build a subscription business often results in inefficient processes with prolonged and complex manual downstream work, hard-coded customizations, and a proliferation of stock-keeping units (SKUs). However, new subscription business models are inherently dynamic, with multiple interactions and constantly-changing relationships and events. The capabilities to launch, price, and bill for products, facilitate and record cash receipts, process and recognize revenue, and analyze data to drive key decisions are mission critical and particularly complex for companies with subscription business models. As a result, as companies launch or grow a subscription business, they often conclude that legacy systems are inadequate. That’s where Zuora comes in. Our vision is “The World Subscribed” -- the idea that one day every company will be a part of the Subscription Economy. Our focus has been on developing software that enables our customers to thrive as a subscription business. Our solution includes Zuora Central Platform, Zuora Billing, Zuora Revenue, Zuora Collect, and other software that support and expand upon these core products. Our software helps companies analyze data - including information such as which customers are delivering the most recurring revenue, or which segments are showing the highest churn, enabling customers to make informed decisions for their subscription business and quickly implement changes such as launching new services, updating pricing (usage, time, or outcome based), delivering new offerings, or making other changes to their customers’ subscription experience. We also have a large subscription ecosystem of global partners and the Subscribed Strategy Group, that can assist our customers with additional strategies and services throughout the subscription journey. Companies in a variety of industries - technology, manufacturing, media and entertainment, telecommunications, and many others - are using our solution to scale and adapt to a world that is increasingly choosing subscription-based offerings. Our customers include over 25 of the Fortune 100 and 8 of the top 10 auto manufacturers. Business Benefits of Using Our Solution Zuora’s products enable companies to: •Enable New Recurring Revenue. Zuora helps companies to transform their existing product-centric business models into subscription services to take advantage of the predictability and resilience of recurring revenue. •Reduce Time to Market. Zuora significantly reduces the time required to go-to-market with new subscription offerings and to iterate on the pricing and packaging of existing offerings, enabling businesses to quickly react to changing market and customer needs, launch new services, and enter new markets. Changes can be made in minutes without having to re-code or re-engineer back office systems. •Increase Operational Efficiencies. Customers regularly make changes to their subscriptions. Zuora automates these processes and reduces the impact of changes, including proration for invoices, changes to revenue recognition, taxation, provisioning, and reporting.

"Item 1. Business. Overview Avalara is a leading provider of tax compliance automation for businesses of all sizes. Every business, regardless of size, faces a bewildering and burdensome array of constantly shifting transaction tax collection, reporting and remittance obligations imposed by a patchwork of local, regional, state, and national taxing authorities. The rise of omnichannel commerce and international trade has increased this compliance burden. Avalara’s mission is to eliminate this burden and allow companies to focus on their core operations. We offer a leading suite of cloud-based solutions to assist companies with transactional tax and related compliance requirements. This multi-product platform - the Avalara Compliance Cloud - consists of calculation, returns, compliance document management, licensing and registration, tax content, and insight solutions. Our vision is for the Avalara Compliance Cloud to be the leading, category-defining, global cloud compliance platform. The changes in global economies and technology adoption are generational shifts in favor of Avalara’s compliance automation business. Increases in digital commerce and ongoing adoption of cloud technologies are behavior and productivity shifts that we expect to continue indefinitely. Alongside mounting regulatory change and government adoption of technology for fiscal transparency and efficiency, businesses around the world are looking for efficient, automated processes to mitigate risk and facilitate growth. Transaction tax rules and regulations change frequently and are neither intuitive nor consistent across taxing jurisdictions, creating a massively complex compliance challenge. Determining the tax due on a particular sale depends not only on the precise geographic location of the transaction within relevant taxing jurisdictions and classifying the product or service into one of thousands of taxation categories, it also can vary based on the date of the transaction because of temporary tax incentives that change the tax rate for specific products, time periods, and transaction thresholds. Further complications to this multi-dimensional challenge arise from duties and taxes assessed on goods crossing national borders, and the thousands of rule changes enacted every year as taxing authorities amend their tax rates and taxability rules, modify jurisdictional boundaries, and implement other regulatory changes. This complexity is often compounded by the necessity to perform transaction tax determination in real time, at the moment a transaction takes place or an invoice is created, and to determine and collect tax on numerous products or services in multiple jurisdictions. These circumstances are increasingly common with the rise of omnichannel commerce wherein businesses employ multiple channels to conduct sales, ranging from traditional in-store point of sale scenarios to multiple ecommerce platforms to digital marketplaces. Sales in these channels employ disparate transactional systems, each of which may contain their own transaction tax solutions ranging from third-party offerings like Avalara to rudimentary or homegrown capabilities. These basic tax calculation capabilities are often not sufficiently robust or current to provide accurate tax determinations for many businesses; more important, as each exists in a siloed channel, they do not offer businesses the ability to aggregate data across systems to enable efficient compliance. Data from those transactions and the associated taxes collected must be aggregated from each of the various systems to enable complete and accurate reporting, tax form preparation, filing, and remittance to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. Traditional methods used by most businesses to aggregate and report transactions are burdensome, costly, and inadequate to the task. They involve manual aggregation and manipulation of data from disparate sources, reference to static tables in spreadsheet software, and reliance on internal staff to track relevant requirements and changes as well as to populate tax returns and ensure timely submission and payment. Businesses relying on inadequate processes for transaction tax compliance risk miscalculations and incorrect collections on the front end, which can result in customer dissatisfaction, and inaccurate filings and payments to authorities on the back end, which can result in significant financial penalties. The Avalara Compliance Cloud combines an advanced database of broad, deep, and up-to-date licensing, registration, and tax content with technology for executing compliance processes, including tax determination, aggregation of transaction data, tax document management, and tax return preparation, filing, and remittance. Our platform powers a suite of products that enables businesses to address the complexity of transaction tax compliance, process transactions in real time, produce records of transaction tax determinations, and reduce errors, audit exposure, and total transaction tax compliance costs. Businesses that use our solutions can allocate fewer personnel to manage transaction tax compliance and focus their efforts on core business operations. The Avalara Compliance Cloud is designed to integrate seamlessly with our customers’ business applications and be easy to administer and maintain. As transactions are executed in our customers’ business applications, the Avalara Compliance Cloud performs a series of operations to deliver tax compliance functionality. This functionality is enabled through an application programming interface (“API”), with customers and partners leveraging our pre-built integrations that connect to business applications used for accounting, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), ecommerce, marketplaces, point of sale (“POS”), recurring billing, and customer relationship management (“CRM”) systems, or developing API calls directly into their systems. These integrations are designed to reduce the need for custom configurations and ongoing oversight by customers. Our cloud architecture ensures that our tax content updates are automatically applied to tax determinations when called by our customers’ applications. Our powerful and intuitive web-based console simplifies configuration and unifies administration, reporting, and returns processing across a customer’s multiple business applications. Because our solutions are deeply embedded in our customers’ business processes and systems and provide an automated solution that is central to their ability to transact, we become critical business partners with our customers that foster substantial long-term relationships, as evidenced by our low revenue churn and high net revenue retention rate. Businesses across industries and of all sizes, ranging from small companies to Fortune 100 enterprises, use our solutions. While mid-market and smaller customers, with 20 to 500 employees, have historically been our primary target segment for marketing and selling our solutions, we are focused on extending our customer reach through investments in product and go-to-market capabilities that address the enterprise and emerging small business...","Avalara is a leading provider of tax compliance automation for businesses of all sizes.

Enterprises are undergoing an acceleration of their digital transformation initiatives as they seek to adapt to work-from-home realities, create new revenue streams, transition to new digital business models and increase customer engagement. Concurrently, enterprises are becoming more distributed as the adoption of cloud, mobile, global and remote workforces and the Internet of Things (“IoT”) move data, applications and access requirements beyond the traditional network perimeter. These enterprises must contend with an evolving cyber-threat landscape, new privacy directives and stringent regulatory requirements. As a result, enterprises require Intelligent Identity solutions that proactively ensure the right user has authorized access to resources at the appropriate time. The Ping Intelligent Identity Platform can secure all primary identity use cases, including customer, workforce, partner and IoT. For example, enterprises can use our platform to enhance their customers’ user experience by creating a single ID and login across web and mobile properties. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 45% of our subscription revenue was derived from the customer use case. Enterprises can also use our platform to provide their workforce and commercial partners with secure, seamless access from any device to the applications, data and APIs they need to be productive.

Our SSO, Access Security and Directory solutions typically replace legacy and homegrown systems. We also have significant greenfield opportunities with our MFA, Dynamic Authorization, Risk Management, Identity Verification and API Intelligence solutions and the IoT use case. Our land and expand strategy targets enterprises with a specific use case and solution or solution package, and then seeks to grow our footprint with additional use cases, identities, solutions and solution packages. The success of our strategy is validated by our strong dollar-based net retention rates, which were 108% and 115% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and our growing number of large customers.

(collectively with our subsidiaries, referred to as “Veritone,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) is a provider of artificial intelligence (“AI”) computing solutions. We are driven by the belief that AI is key to building a safer, more vibrant, transparent and empowered society. Our mission is to be an active contributor to making the world better through AI. Today, over 80% of new data created worldwide is unstructured, which is increasing at an annual growth rate of 30-60% per year, according to Gartner (2020 Strategic Roadmap for Storage, July 1, 2020). This creates significant challenges for companies and governments across the globe - specifically, how to create systematic solutions to address the ever-increasing volume of unstructured data. Whether it is a local police department trying to rapidly solve crimes through analysis of video evidence, a media company searching years of television archives for specific images and video content, or the U.S. military trying to analyze huge volumes of satellite and other aerial images, we believe AI is the only efficient solution to these complex challenges. To address the ever-growing challenges surrounding unstructured data, we developed aiWARE™, our proprietary AI operating system. aiWARE orchestrates machine learning algorithms, or AI models, together with a suite of powerful applications, to reveal valuable insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. Our multi-faceted aiWARE platform offers capabilities that mimic human cognitive functions such as perception, prediction, problem solving and optimization, enabling users to quickly, efficiently and cost effectively transform unstructured data into structured data, and analyze and optimize data to drive business processes and insights. aiWARE is based on an open architecture that enables new AI models, applications and workflows to be added quickly and efficiently, resulting in a future proof, scalable and evolving solution that can be easily leveraged by organizations in a broad range of industries that capture or use audio, video and other unstructured data, together with structured data, such as the media and entertainment, government, legal and compliance, energy and other vertical markets, driving down the cost, complexity and time to develop, deploy and distribute AI-enabled applications in their operations. Our aiWARE platform is offered primarily through a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) delivery model and can be deployed in a number of environments and configurations to meet customers’ needs. We believe the opportunity to create a sustainable and growing business around AI and AI-enabled solutions is large and growing significantly. According to Omdia (Artificial Intelligence Software Market Forecast, 2020), the AI market today is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35%, to reach $100.0 billion in 2025. We believe that our current solutions address opportunities in intelligent process automation, machine learning operations and AI platform and developer tools, which markets are expected to total approximately $34.5 billion by 2025.

Markets and Markets, AI Platform Market Trends, Growth, Size and Share - 2022 (November 2017) In particular, we believe that there are tremendous near and long term opportunities to grow our business in the government and energy markets. According to Bloomberg Government (BGOV) (Fiscal 2021 Government Contracting Playbook, 2020), the U.S. Government is preparing to invest more than $6 billion in AI-related research and development projects in fiscal 2021. The U.S. General Services Administration’s Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence and the U.S. Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center have been created to speed the adoption of AI technologies by civilian and defense agencies, respectively, and the U.S. Departments of Energy and Veterans Affairs have opened their own AI research offices. Meanwhile, federal contract spending on AI is on pace to grow by almost 50%, according to BGOV projections, reaching $3.0 billion in fiscal 2021. In the energy market, according to Frost and Sullivan (Growth Opportunities from Decarbonization in the Global Power Market, 2019-2030), it is estimated that $3.4 trillion will be invested in renewable energy over the next 10 years. We believe that the applicability of our AI solutions will extend beyond utilities and across the global $1.5 trillion electric energy market (inspirecleanenergy.com, Understanding the Energy Market, March 2017), including improved optimization to reduce energy production lost, which we have estimated to be over $21 billion in the U.S. annually over the last 10 years based on data published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (Frequently Asked Questions, https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/index.php). We have expanded and enhanced our aiWARE SaaS solutions and services through acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies. Through our acquisition of Wazee Digital, Inc. (“Wazee Digital”) in 2018, we added to our offerings digital asset management solutions and digital content licensing services. We have integrated the cognitive functionality of aiWARE with these Wazee Digital solutions and services, which allows us to provide our customers with unique capabilities to more effectively monetize and enrich their content. In 2017, we acquired the advanced data analytics software and related intellectual property assets of Atigeo Corporation, including its cooperative distributed inferencing (“CDI”) technology that is based on Hamiltonian models and other proprietary algorithms, adding proprietary AI-based forecasting, optimization and intelligent control capabilities to our growing body of technology and intellectual property in data science. We have developed solutions utilizing our CDI technology to address a number of use cases, particularly in the energy market, and we have integrated these solutions with aiWARE to deploy, integrate and operate them for customers. We plan to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses and technologies that strengthen our business, enhance our AI capabilities and/or expand our market presence in our core vertical markets or in new markets. Leveraging our AI media solutions, we also operate a full service advertising agency, which we expanded in 2018 through our acquisition of S Media Limited, doing business as Performance Bridge Media (“Performance Bridge”), a leading podcast advertising agency, becoming one of the world’s largest full service performance-based audio advertising agencies...."," Veritone, Inc.

"Item 1. Business Overview We are a pioneer and leading provider of a cloud-based platform delivering information technology (IT), security and compliance solutions. Our integrated suite of IT, security and compliance solutions delivered on our Qualys Cloud Platform enables our customers to: 1) identify and manage their IT assets across on-premises, endpoints, cloud, containers, and mobile environments; 2) collect and analyze large amounts of IT security data; 3) discover and prioritize vulnerabilities; 4) recommend and implement remediation actions; and 5) verify the implementation of such actions. This helps organizations protect their systems and applications from ever-evolving cyber-attacks and helps achieve compliance with internal policies and external regulations. Our cloud solutions address the growing IT, security and compliance complexities and risks that are amplified by the dissolving boundaries between internal and external IT infrastructures and web environments, the rapid adoption of cloud computing, containers and serverless IT models, and the proliferation of geographically dispersed IT assets. Organizations use our integrated suite of solutions to cost-effectively obtain a unified view of their IT asset inventory as well as security and compliance posture across globally-distributed IT infrastructures as our solution offers a single platform for information technology, information security, application security, endpoint, developer security and cloud teams. IT infrastructures are more complex and globally-distributed today than ever before, as organizations of all sizes increasingly rely upon a myriad of interconnected information systems and related IT assets, such as servers, databases, web applications, routers, switches, desktops, laptops, other physical and virtual infrastructure, and numerous external networks and cloud services. In this environment, new and evolving digital technologies intended to improve organizations’ operations can also increase vulnerability to cyber-attacks, which can expose sensitive data, damage IT and physical infrastructures, and result in serious financial or reputational consequences. In addition, the rapidly increasing amount of data and devices in IT environments makes it more difficult to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner. The predominant approach to IT security has been to implement multiple disparate security products that can be costly and difficult to deploy, integrate and manage and may not adequately protect organizations. As a result, we believe there is a large and growing opportunity for comprehensive cloud-based IT, security and compliance solutions delivered in a single platform. We designed our Qualys Cloud Platform to transform the way organizations secure and protect their IT infrastructures and applications. Our cloud platform offers an integrated suite of solutions that automates the lifecycle of asset discovery and management, security assessments, and compliance management for an organization’s IT infrastructure and assets, whether such infrastructure and assets reside inside the organization, on their network perimeter, on endpoints or in the cloud. Since inception, our solutions have been designed to be delivered through the cloud and to be easily and rapidly deployed on a global scale, enabling faster implementation and lower total cost of ownership than traditional on-premises enterprise software products. Our customers, ranging from some of the largest global organizations to small businesses, are served from our globally-distributed cloud platform, enabling us to rapidly deliver new solutions, enhancements and security updates. We believe that our cloud platform provides our customers with unique advantages, including: • No hardware to buy or manage. There is no infrastructure or software to buy and maintain thus reducing our customers’ operating costs; all services are accessible in the cloud via web interface. Qualys operates and maintains the platform. • Real-time visibility in one place, anytime and anywhere. Our customers can conveniently see their security and compliance posture across their global IT asset inventory in one browser window, without plugins or a virtual private network (VPN), whenever and wherever Internet access is available. • Easy global scanning. Our customers can easily perform scans on geographically distributed and segmented networks at the perimeter, behind the firewall, on dynamic cloud environments and on endpoints. • Seamless scaling. Our cloud platform is a scalable, comprehensive, and end-to-end solution for the IT, security and compliance needs of our customers. Our customers can seamlessly add new coverage, users and services after they have deployed our platform. • Up to date resources. Qualys has one of the largest knowledge bases of vulnerability signatures in the industry. All security updates are made in real-time. • Data stored securely. Data is securely stored and processed in a multi-tiered architecture of load-balanced servers. Our encrypted databases are physically and logically secured. We were founded and incorporated in December 1999 with a vision of transforming the way organizations secure and protect their IT infrastructure and applications and initially launched our first cloud solution, Vulnerability Management (VM), in 2000. As VM gained acceptance, we introduced additional solutions to help customers manage increasing IT, security and compliance requirements. Today, the suite of solutions that we offer on our cloud platform and refer to as the Qualys Cloud Apps helps our customers protect a range of assets across on-premises, endpoints, cloud, containers, and mobile environments. These Cloud Apps address and include: • IT Security: Vulnerability Management (VM), Vulnerability Management, Detection and Response (VMDR), Threat Protection (TP), Continuous Monitoring (CM), Patch Management (PM), Multi-Vector Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Indication of Compromise (IOC), Certificate Assessment (CRA); • Compliance: Policy Compliance (PC), Security Configuration Assessment (SCA), PCI Compliance (PCI), File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), Security Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), Out of-Band Configuration Assessment (OCA); • Web Application Security: Web Application Scanning (WAS), Web Application Firewall (WAF); • Asset Management: Global IT Asset Inventory (AI), CMDB Sync (SYN), Certificate Inventory (CRI); and • Cloud/Container Security: Cloud Inventory (CI), Cloud Security Assessment (CSA), Container Security (CS). We provide our solutions through a software-as-a-service model, primarily with renewable annual subscriptions. These subscriptions require customers to pay a fee in order to access each of our cloud solutions. We generally invoice our customers for the entire subscription amount at the start of the subscription term, and the invoiced amounts are treated as deferred revenues and are recognized ratably over the term of each subscription.

"ITEM 1. BUSINESS We believe in a data connected world where organizations have seamless access to explore, share, and unlock the value of data. To realize this vision, we deliver the Data Cloud, an ecosystem where Snowflake customers, partners, data providers, and data consumers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways. Our platform is the innovative technology that powers the Data Cloud, enabling customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, build data-driven applications, and share data. We provide our platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use. Snowflake solves the decades-old problem of data silos and data governance. Leveraging the elasticity and performance of the public cloud, our platform enables customers to unify and query data to support a wide variety of use cases. It also provides frictionless and governed data access so users can securely share data inside and outside of their organizations, generally without copying or moving the underlying data. As a result, customers can blend existing data with new data for broader context, augment data science efforts, and create new monetization streams. Delivered as a service, our platform requires near-zero maintenance, enabling customers to focus on deriving value from their data rather than managing infrastructure. Our cloud-native architecture consists of three independently scalable layers across storage, compute, and cloud services. The storage layer ingests massive amounts and varieties of structured and semi-structured data to create a unified data record. The compute layer provides dedicated resources to enable users to simultaneously access common data sets for many use cases without latency. The cloud services layer intelligently optimizes each use case’s performance requirements with no administration. This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 23 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are interconnected to deliver the Data Cloud, enabling a consistent, global user experience. Our platform supports a wide range of use cases that enable our customers’ most important business objectives, including data warehousing, data lakes, data engineering, data science, data application development, and data sharing. From January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2021, we processed an average of over 777 million daily queries across all of our customer accounts, up from an average of over 364 million daily queries during the corresponding month of the prior fiscal year. Our business benefits from powerful network effects. The Data Cloud will continue to grow as organizations move their siloed data from cloud-based repositories and on-premises data centers to the Data Cloud. The more customers adopt our platform, the more data can be exchanged with other Snowflake customers, partners, data providers, and data consumers, enhancing the value of our platform for all users. We believe this network effect will help us drive our vision of the Data Cloud. Our platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. As of January 31, 2021, we had 4,139 total customers, increasing from 2,392 customers as of January 31, 2020. As of January 31, 2021, our customers included 186 of the Fortune 500, based on the 2020 Fortune 500 list, and those customers contributed approximately 27% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. Our Fortune 500 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the Fortune 500 list by Fortune, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers. As our customers experience the benefits of our platform, they typically expand their usage significantly, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate, which was 168% as of January 31, 2021. The number of customers that contributed more than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue increased from 41 to 77 as of January 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We have achieved significant growth in recent periods. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our revenue was $592.0 million, $264.7 million, and $96.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 124% and 174%, respectively. Our net loss was $539.1 million, $348.5 million, and $178.0 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The Rise of the Data Cloud Data exists everywhere, but is often held hostage in silos by machines, applications, networks, and clouds. In order to access the value of this data, organizations are undergoing massive digital transformation initiatives, and data is driving operations for many modern enterprises. In an effort to mobilize data, companies have invested billions of dollars in disparate on-premises systems, infrastructure clouds, and application clouds. Yet, there are a myriad of challenges associated with legacy data solutions and the data silo problem persists. We believe the Data Cloud can enable a world without data silos, allowing organizations to effortlessly discover, access, derive insights from, and share data from a variety of sources. Customers can share and provide access to each other’s data, augment data science and machine learning algorithms with more data sets, connect global supply chains through data hubs, and create new monetization channels by connecting data providers and consumers. As the Data Cloud grows through broad adoption and increasing usage, there are enhanced benefits from greater data availability. Our Solution Our platform is built on a cloud-native architecture that leverages the massive scalability and performance of the public cloud. Our platform allows customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, power applications, and share data across regions and public clouds. Key elements of our platform include: •Diverse data types.

"ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview of Business Blackboxstocks, Inc. is a financial technology and social media hybrid platform offering real-time proprietary analytics and news for stock and options traders of all levels. Our web-based software (the “Blackbox System”) employs “predictive technology” enhanced by artificial intelligence to find volatility and unusual market activity that may result in the rapid change in the price of a stock or option. We continuously scan the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), NASDAQ, Chicago Board Options Exchange (the “CBOE”), and other options markets, analyzing over 8,000 stocks and over 1,000,000 options contracts multiple times per second. We provide our users with a fully interactive social media platform that is integrated into our dashboard, enabling our users to exchange information and ideas quickly and efficiently through a common network. We recently introduced a live audio/video feature that allows our members to broadcast on their own channels to share trading strategies and market insight within the Blackbox community. We employ a subscription based Software as a Service (“SaaS”) business model and maintain a growing base of users that spans 42 countries. The Blackbox System is a unique and disruptive financial technology platform combining proprietary analytics and broadcast enabled social media to connect traders of all types worldwide on an intuitive, user-friendly system. The complexity of our backend analytics is neatly hidden from the end user by our simple and easy to navigate dashboard which includes real-time alerts, scanners, financial news, institutional grade charting and proprietary analytics. Development of the Blackbox System The Blackbox System was made available for use to subscribing customers worldwide in September 2016. In December 2017, we launched our first Options Flow Scanner as a new feature on our platform. Our Options Flow Scanner is designed to monitor and alert our users to unusual activity on the options exchange. We have created many proprietary options alerts and a proprietary options “heatmap” to allow our users to follow large options purchases in real-time. This has proven to be a very popular feature for our users. We also added a Dark Pool Scanner in 2020. The Dark Pool Scanner feature monitors, tracks and displays large blocks of stock that are often purchased in dark pools and not on the regular exchanges. In October of 2020 we completed a system integration with the online brokerage platform TradeStation. This integration allows Blackbox users that have an account with TradeStation to trade directly through the Blackbox platform without leaving our dashboard. We also provide our users with a full set of internal social media functions within our dashboard. These features include chat rooms, direct messaging, follow/block capability, custom user profiles, and most importantly broadcast enabled audio channels. We believe that combining these social media features with our analytics, within a single dashboard provides a unique user experience allowing for the rapid exchange of information and consensus throughout our community. The resulting dynamic is what we describe as “the best of man and machine”. We are in the process of developing and anticipate adding many new features and functions to the Blackbox System, including but not limited to, native iOS and Android mobile applications, a crypto currency analytics and trading platform, as well as a comprehensive watchlist and portfolio management system. In January of 2021 we deployed an intermediate native application for iOS an Android phones to send push notifications to our users which allowed us to cease using a third-party solution that was inefficient and cumbersome. We are also in the process of upgrading our current chat and audio broadcast feature. Development of planned features and functions are expected to cost approximately $250,000. Marketing of the Blackbox System The Company launched its Blackbox System web application for domestic use and made it available to subscribers in September 2016. Use of the Blackbox System is sold on a monthly or annual subscription basis to individual consumers through our website at http://www.blackboxstocks.com. We believe our Blackbox System subscriptions are priced competitively with similar web-based trading tools. We primarily use a combination of digital marketing campaigns and customer referral compensation plans in our advertising program. Our digital advertising efforts utilize banner and similar marketing on social media platforms as well as targeted email. We believe that this form of advertising has been and will continue to be effective in attracting subscribers. We continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of specific social media platforms and allocate marketing funds accordingly. We also promote our subscriptions through an established compensated customer referral program. We offer certain subscribers the right to promote the Blackbox System and receive referral fees for subscribers generated from such subscribers’ effort. Generally, we pay referring subscribers $25 for each subscription generated and $25 for each month the subscriber continues their subscription. We incurred $272,908 and $121,227 in customer referral expenditures in each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to continue utilizing the customer referral sales program as it has proven to be an extremely efficient form of advertising. Our advertising and marketing expense was $705,706 and $261,470 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We intend to continue to deploy a significant amount of marketing funds on both digital campaigns and customer referral programs in the future. In addition, we may also utilize television and radio advertising. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product coding and marks. As of the date of this report, the Company has not yet registered any trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property associated with our business. Government Regulation and Approvals The Company offers its subscribing customers a trading tool and not a trading platform, broker dealer or exchange, and therefore does not expect to be subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC, FINRA or other financial regulatory agencies. We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals required for the marketing or use...","Blackboxstocks, Inc. is a financial technology and social media hybrid platform offering real-time proprietary analytics and news for stock and options traders of all levels.

"Item 1. Business Overview MongoDB is the leading modern, general purpose database platform. Our robust platform enables developers to build and modernize applications rapidly and cost-effectively across a broad range of use cases. Organizations can deploy our platform at scale in the cloud, on-premise, or in a hybrid environment. Through our unique document-based architecture, we are able to address the needs of organizations for performance, scalability, flexibility and reliability while maintaining the strengths of legacy databases. Our business model combines the developer mindshare and adoption benefits of open source with the economic benefits of a proprietary software subscription business model. Software applications are redefining how organizations across industries engage with their customers, operate their businesses and compete with each other. To compete effectively in today’s global, data-driven market environment, organizations must provide their end-users with applications that capture and leverage the vast volumes and varieties of available data. As a result, the software developers who build and maintain these applications are increasingly influential in organizations and demand for their talent has grown substantially. Consequently, organizations of all sizes and industries and across geographies have significantly increased investment in developers with the strategic goal of improving the organization’s pace of innovation and competitive position. A database is at the heart of every software application. Every software application requires a database to store, organize and process data. Large organizations can have tens of thousands of applications and associated databases. A database directly impacts an application's performance, scalability, flexibility and reliability. As a result, selecting a database is a highly strategic decision that directly affects developer productivity, application performance and organizational competitiveness. Legacy relational databases were first developed in the 1970s and their underlying architecture remains largely unchanged even though the nature of applications, how they are deployed and their role in business have evolved dramatically. Modern software development is highly iterative and requires flexibility. Relational databases were not built to support the volume, variety and velocity of data being generated today, hindering application performance and developer productivity. In a relational database environment, developers are often required to spend significant time fixing and maintaining the linkages between modern applications and the rigid database structures that are inherent in relational offerings. Further, relational databases were built before cloud computing was popularized and were not designed for “always-on” globally distributed deployments. These factors have left developers and their organizations in need of more agile and effective database alternatives. A number of non-relational database alternatives have attempted to address the limitations of relational databases, but they have not achieved widespread developer mindshare and marketplace adoption due to technical trade-offs in their product architectures and the resulting compromises developers are required to make in application development. When we refer to a modern database, we are referring to a database that was originally commercialized after the year 2000 and that is designed for globally distributed deployments. Our unique platform combines the best of both relational and non-relational databases. We believe our core platform differentiation is driven by our ability to address the needs of organizations for performance, scalability, flexibility and reliability while maintaining the strengths of relational databases. Our document-based architecture enables developers to manage data in a more natural way, making it easy and intuitive for developers to rapidly and cost-effectively build, modernize, deploy and maintain applications, thereby increasing the pace of innovation within an organization. Customers can run our platform in any environment, depending on their operational requirements: fully managed as a service or self-managed in the cloud, on-premise or in a hybrid environment. The database market is one of the largest in the software industry. According to IDC, the worldwide database software market, which it refers to as the data management software market, was forecast to be $68 billion in 2020 growing to approximately $106 billion in 2024, representing a 12% compound annual growth rate. Legacy database vendors have historically dominated this market. We believe this market is one of the few within the enterprise technology stack that has yet to be disrupted by a modern alternative, creating our opportunity. To encourage developer usage, familiarity and adoption of our platform, we offer Community Server, a free-to-download version of our database that is analogous to a “freemium” offering. This allows developers to evaluate our platform in a frictionless manner, which we believe has contributed to our platform's popularity among developers and driven enterprise adoption of our subscription offering. Prior to October 2018, we offered Community Server under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (the “AGPL”). In October 2018, we issued a new software license, the Server Side Public License (the “SSPL”), for all versions of Community Server released after that date. Both the SSPL and the AGPL grant licensees broad freedom to view, use, copy, modify and redistribute the source code of Community Server provided certain conditions are met. The SSPL is based on the AGPL but includes an explicit condition that any organization using Community Server to offer MongoDB as a third-party service must open source the software that it uses to offer such service. The economic attractiveness of our subscription-based model is driven by customer renewals and increasing existing customer subscriptions over time, referred to as land-and-expand. Unlike software companies built around third-party open source projects, we own the intellectual property of our offerings since we are the creators of the software, enabling our proprietary software subscription business model. Owning the intellectual property of our offering also allows us to retain control over our future product roadmap, including the determination of which features are included in our free or paid offerings.

"ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc. (“SailPoint,” “the Company” or “we”) is the leading provider of enterprise identity security solutions. SailPoint was launched by a team of visionary industry veterans to empower our customers to efficiently and securely govern the digital identities of employees, contractors, business partners, software bots and other human and non-human users, and manage their constantly changing access rights to enterprise applications and data. Our identity security solutions provide organizations with critical visibility into who currently has access to which resources, who should have access to those resources and how that access is being used. We offer both software as a service (“SaaS”) and software solutions, which provide organizations the intelligence required to empower users and govern their access to systems, applications and data across hybrid IT environments, spanning on-premises and cloud applications and file storage platforms. We help customers enable their businesses with more agile and innovative IT, streamline delivery of access to their businesses, enhance their security posture and better meet compliance and regulatory requirements. Our customers include many of the world’s largest and most complex organizations, including commercial enterprises, financial institutions and governments. Organizations globally are investing in technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence (""AI"") and machine learning (""ML"") to improve employee productivity, business agility and competitiveness. Today, enterprise environments are more open and interconnected with their business partners, contractors, vendors and customers. Business users have driven a dramatic increase in the number of applications and amount of data that organizations need to manage, much of which sits beyond the traditional network perimeter. Because of these trends, the attack surface is expanding while well-funded cyber attackers, in some cases sponsored by nation-states, have significantly increased the frequency and sophistication of their attacks. For example, it has been reported that the SolarWinds breach was part of a highly sophisticated, broad and coordinated nation-state cyber operation that targeted the IT infrastructure of the United States and potentially other countries as well. As a result, IT professionals need to manage and secure increasingly complex hybrid IT environments within these extended enterprises. Attackers frequently target the identity vector as it allows them to leverage user identities to gain access to high-value systems and data while concealing their activity and movements within an organization’s IT infrastructure. The consequences of a data breach can be extremely damaging, with organizations facing significant costs to remediate the breach and repair brand and reputational damage. In addition, governments and regulatory bodies have increased efforts to protect users and their data with a new wave of regulatory and compliance measures that are further burdening organizations and levying severe penalties for non-compliance. As a result of these trends, enterprises are struggling to efficiently manage and secure their digital identities. We believe that our identity security solutions are a critical, foundational layer of a modern cyber security strategy, which increasingly leverages a zero-trust approach for securing access. Open architecture allows our solutions to complement and build upon traditional perimeter- and endpoint-centric security solutions, which we believe on their own are increasingly insufficient to secure organizations, and their applications and data. We deliver an identity security platform that combines identity and data governance solutions to form a holistic view of the enterprise's identities, both human and non-human. In combination with our technology partners, we create identity awareness throughout our customers’ environments by providing valuable insights into, and incorporating information from, a broad range of enterprise software and security solutions. Our governance platform provides a system of record for digital identities across our customers’ IT environments while allowing them to remain agile and competitive. Our adaptable solutions integrate seamlessly into existing technology stacks, allowing organizations to maximize the value of their technology investments. Our professionals work closely with customers throughout the implementation lifecycle, from documentation to development to integration. Our solutions address the complex needs of global enterprises and mid-market organizations. Our go-to-market strategy consists of both direct sales and indirect sales through resellers, such as Optiv, and system integrators. Our mature system integrator channel includes global consultants such as Accenture, Deloitte, Ernst & Young (“EY”), KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”), all of whom have dedicated SailPoint practices, with some dating back more than 10 years. Our Growth Strategy Key investments we are making to drive growth include: •Driving new customer growth within existing geographic markets. There is a significant opportunity to expand our footprint through both new, greenfield deployments and displacement of competitive legacy solutions in the markets that we currently serve. We plan to expand our customer base in these countries by continuing to grow our sales organization, expand and leverage our channel partnerships and enhance our marketing efforts. •Further penetrating our existing customer base. Our customer base of 1,753, as of December 31, 2020, provides a significant opportunity to drive incremental sales. Our customers have the flexibility to start with a single use case or project and expand over time. As they realize the value of their investment, new use cases and deployments are identified, allowing us to sell more products to existing customers and to expand the number and types of identities, including non-human and machine identities, and governed systems we cover within their organizations. This is especially true when it comes to our new and expanded SaaS offerings, including AI and cloud governance. We believe strong customer satisfaction is fundamental to our ability to expand our customer relationships. •Continuing to invest in our platform. Innovation is a core part of our culture. We believe we have established a reputation as a technology leader and innovator in identity security. We intend to continue investing, particularly in our SaaS offerings, to extend our position as the leader in identity security by developing or acquiring new products and technologies. •Leveraging and expanding our network of partners. Our partnerships with global system integrators, such as Accenture, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC, and resellers, such as Optiv, have helped us extend our reach and serve our customers more effectively.

"Item 1. Business Overview Sumo Logic empowers organizations to close the intelligence gap. Sumo Logic is the pioneer of Continuous Intelligence, a new category of software, which enables organizations of all sizes to address the challenges and opportunities presented by digital transformation, modern applications, and cloud computing. Our Continuous Intelligence Platform enables organizations to automate the collection, ingestion, and analysis of application, infrastructure, security, and IoT data to derive actionable insights within seconds. Continuous intelligence leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, and is provided as a multi-tenant cloud service that allows organizations to more rapidly deliver reliable applications and digital services, protect against modern security threats, and consistently optimize their business processes in real time. This empowers employees across all lines of business, development, IT, and security teams with the data and insights needed to address the technology and collaboration challenges required for modern business. With our Continuous Intelligence Platform, executives and employees have the intelligence they require to take prescriptive action in real time-a modern business imperative. We live in the intelligence economy. Organizations can succeed or fail based on how well they understand and respond to what is happening inside their business. Reports, surveys, or monitoring alerts provided by traditional operational and security technologies and manual processes are no longer effective. Today, businesses generate data from multiple sources-every touchpoint, customer interaction, and digital connection across an entire business and ecosystem. This represents an unprecedented volume of data that is growing at an extraordinary pace which is, at best, difficult to digest and, at worst, an impediment to driving the speed of decision-making needed to compete in today’s dynamic marketplaces. Businesses thriving in the intelligence economy are taking a completely different approach to solving the intelligence gap, by seeking out solutions that provide real-time continuous intelligence that improves how they collectively and collaboratively build, manage, and secure their digital services. Organizations that will be successful in the digital age must be able to utilize their most important resource: their data. Our vision is to democratize machine data, making insights from this rich source available to all. Our Continuous Intelligence Platform gives our customers insights across a wide range of use cases. We help our customers: monitor and troubleshoot their applications and their cloud and on-premise infrastructure; manage audit and compliance requirements; rapidly detect and resolve modern security threats; and extract critical key performance indicators, or KPIs, from various types of machine data to gain visibility into customer behavior, engagement, and actions. We enable our customers to derive critical value from their data with advanced analytics based on our proprietary machine learning technology that identifies and predicts anomalies in real time. Our multi-tenant, cloud-native platform was architected by big data and security experts and has been in operation continuously for nearly a decade. Our platform is built on a modern, microservices-based application and cloud architecture, leverages security-first principles, and incorporates AI/ML algorithms to deliver real-time actionable insights. We started in 2010 with the mission to provide organizations with the ability to ingest and analyze complex unstructured machine data, such as logs, events and security data for a cloud SIEM solution. However, we always had the vision to expand our data analytics capabilities to address less complex structured machine data, such as time-series metrics from applications and infrastructure, to provide a cloud-native operational intelligence solution. Our platform integrates and analyzes structured, semi-structured, and unstructured machine data, both historically and in real time, to provide actionable intelligence around what happened, why it happened, and how to resolve business, technology, or cybersecurity issues. We deliberately architected and built our analytics platform to address the technology challenges and gaps in intelligence that arise from siloed development, operations, and security teams in order to enable organizations to adopt a more modern DevSecOps operating model. DevSecOps is the philosophy of integrating security practices within the DevOps process, and involves ongoing, flexible collaboration among developers, release engineers, and security teams. DevOps is a combination of practices that automates the processes between software development and operations teams in order to build, test, and deploy modern applications faster. Ultimately, it enables teams to gain more insights and intelligence in order to release software faster, optimize processes, and better deliver digital solutions to customers. We offer a suite of solutions to address the intelligence gap: Operational Intelligence, Security Intelligence, Business Intelligence, and Global Intelligence. We address both cloud-native businesses, as well as traditional on-premise businesses that are seeking to build, manage, and secure modern applications as they undertake their digital transformation and cloud adoption initiatives. We serve organizations of all sizes, from large enterprises to small and mid-market businesses, regardless of their cloud, digital transformation, security analytics, or DevSecOps maturity. Industry Background Nearly every business must transform into a digital business or be disrupted. Customers now expect real-time, instantaneous, always-on experiences. To meet these expectations, successful businesses need to continuously deliver updated information and improved services to their end customers, such as promotional offerings, pricing information, inventory levels, and service availability. Every business must continuously innovate. Executives are accountable for the overall operational and financial health of the business and can no longer hide behind a gap in intelligence. This is especially true for security, as organizations must protect against breaches and reputational costs as they digitize. This accountability is not only the responsibility of executives. Employees across the organization are now expected to find ways to improve intelligence by integrating silos that exist across systems, applications, services, and processes. Today, every company is becoming a software company by delivering more business services through modern applications, automating workflows, and leveraging data from digital signals to satisfy increasing customer expectations. To enable differentiated digital services, organizations must take a new approach to software architectures, tools, and development processes that span multiple public cloud providers while simultaneously securing their digital assets. We believe all businesses require the following five pillars to be successful in the intelligence economy.

We generate revenues primarily through our high-value software-enabled services. Our software-enabled services are generally provided under contracts with initial terms of one to five years that require monthly or quarterly payments and are subject to automatic annual renewal at the end of the initial term unless terminated by either party. We also generate revenues by licensing our software to clients through either perpetual or term licenses and by selling maintenance services. Maintenance services are generally provided under annually renewable contracts. Pricing in our software-enabled services businesses scales based on several factors which can include our clients’ assets under management, the complexity of asset classes managed, the number of accounts serviced, the volume of transactions, trading volume, medical claims and pharmacy claims volume and the level of service the client requires. We have experienced average revenue retention rates in each of the last five years of greater than 90% on our software-enabled services and maintenance and term licenses contracts for our core enterprise products. We believe that the high value-added nature of our products and services has enabled us to maintain our high revenue retention rates. We generated revenues of $4,667.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to revenues of $4,632.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In 2020, we generated 77% of our revenues from clients in North America and 23% from clients outside North America. Our revenues are highly diversified, with our largest client in 2020 accounting for less than 5% of our revenues. Additional financial information, including geographic information, is available in our Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Industry We serve a number of vertical markets within the financial services and healthcare industries. Our financial services clients include alternative investment funds, investment management firms, institutional and retail asset managers, insurance companies, registered investment advisors (“RIAs”), wealth managers, banks and brokerage firms. Our healthcare clients include individual and government sponsored health plans and healthcare providers. We believe that financial services and healthcare providers will increasingly turn to IT solutions, provided by an independent vendor, as a result of economic challenges and heightened regulatory requirements. Financial services firms are in a search for more risk-averse business strategies, simplified regulatory compliance, and full service solutions provided by a single vendor. Healthcare providers are looking to improve their customers’ experience through better access to data and an enhanced user interface. As a result, we believe these industries will continue to invest in IT and outsourcing solutions.

"ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview ZoomInfo is a leading go-to-market intelligence platform for sales and marketing teams. Our cloud-based go-to-market data and insights platform delivers comprehensive and high-quality intelligence and analytics to provide sales and marketing professionals accurate information and insights on the organizations and professionals they target enabling our customers to shorten sales cycles and increase win rates by enabling sellers and marketers to deliver the right message, to the right person, at the right time. We are able to deliver high-quality intelligence at scale by leveraging an artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning (“ML”) powered engine that gathers data from millions of sources in real time and standardizes, matches to entities, verifies, cleans, and applies the processed data to companies and people at scale. This data engine and our team of research analysts and data scientists enrich our platform by providing deep insights, such as personnel moves, pain points, or planned investments, technologies used by companies, intent signals, decision-maker contact information, advanced attributes (such as time series growth, granular department and location information, and employee trends), organizational charts, news and events, hierarchy information, locations, and funding details. Our customers access insights directly in our platform and can also integrate our data and insights directly into their customer relationship management system (“CRM”) or sales and marketing automation systems, to improve their existing go-to-market processes. ZoomInfo, formerly known as DiscoverOrg, was co-founded in 2007 by our CEO, Henry Schuck. DiscoverOrg achieved significant organic growth since its founding and acquired Zoom Information, Inc. (“Pre-Acquisition ZI”) in February 2019 to further expand the breadth of our go-to-market intelligence, industry coverage, and addressable market opportunity. The combined business was incorporated as ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. in November 2019 for the purposes of facilitating the IPO. On June 8, 2020, ZoomInfo completed the IPO. Our corporate headquarters are located in Vancouver, Washington. The company has additional offices across the United States, including in Waltham, Massachusetts; Bellevue, Washington; Bethesda, Maryland; Conshohocken, Pennsylvania; Grand Rapids, Michigan; San Mateo, California; and Atlanta, Georgia, as well as a presence in Ra’anana, Israel. Our primary website address is www.zoominfo.com. The information on our website is not incorporated herein or otherwise a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Platform Our cloud-based go-to-market data and insights platform delivers comprehensive and high-quality intelligence and analytics to provide sales and marketing professionals accurate information and insights on the organizations and professionals they target. We enhance the breadth of this intelligence with deep insights, such as personnel moves, pain points, or planned investments, technologies used by companies, intent signals, decision-maker contact information, advanced attributes (such as time series growth, granular department and location information, and employee trends), organizational charts, news and events, hierarchy information, locations, and funding details. All of this can be integrated directly into our customers’ CRM and sales & marketing automation systems. This 360-degree view provides detailed understanding, and coupled with our analytics, shortens sales cycles and increases win rates by enabling sellers and marketers to deliver the right message, to the right person, at the right time. Our intelligence is kept up to date in real time. This is accomplished through a combination of robust systems and processes leveraging AI, ML, and our proprietary human-in-the-loop approach. Our Data Engine We deliver high-quality intelligence at scale by leveraging an AI and ML powered engine that gathers data from millions of sources and standardizes, matches to entities, verifies, cleans, and applies the processed data to companies and people at scale. We aggregate and extract distinct types of data, such as revenue, locations, technologies, keywords, contact information, including email addresses, titles, and phone numbers, and many others, from millions of public and proprietary sources. Our evidence-based ML algorithm scores, ranks, and makes determinations about these billions of data points each week. To help train our AI and ML technologies and augment our contributory network, we have a team of research analysts and data scientists with deep expertise in cleaning B2B data. This human-in-the-loop team plays a strategic role, focusing on quality assurance and addressing data and intelligence gaps that technology alone cannot solve. We have processes in place to use our research team to tag anomalies in data, review data pieces that require another manual verification, identify patterns to transform this understanding into algorithms, and identify methods to automate data gathering. We are able to provide a guarantee of 95%+ accuracy as a result of our focus on quality. Our Competition We believe there are currently no competitors who offer a sales and marketing intelligence platform as comprehensive as ours. We are able to provide measurable revenue improvement; accuracy, depth and coverage of data; unique data points to leverage insights; and a platform that can be integrated and automated with a variety of CRM or marketing platforms. In limited circumstances, we will see other vendors that focus on specific use-cases, niche end-markets, or leveraging legacy and/or inaccurate data sets try to compete in potential deals. These potential competitors include LinkedIn Sales Navigator, D&B Hoovers, and TechTarget. We believe the principal factors that drive competition between vendors in the market include: •comprehensive platform offering; •quality and accuracy of data; •breadth and depth of data; •ease of use and deployment; •tangible benefits and ROI for customers; •data privacy and security; •ability to integrate with customers’ CRM and sales and marketing automation systems; and •sophistication of solutions used to manage, maintain and combine intelligence.

"ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview SolarWinds is a leading provider of information technology, or IT, infrastructure management software. Our products give organizations worldwide, regardless of type, size or IT infrastructure complexity, the power to monitor and manage the performance of their IT environments, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid models. We combine powerful, scalable, affordable, easy to use products with a high-velocity, low-touch sales model to grow our business while also generating significant cash flow. Our business is focused on building products that enable technology professionals to manage “all things IT.” We continuously engage with technology professionals to understand the challenges they face maintaining high-performing and highly available on-premises, public and private cloud and hybrid IT infrastructures. The insights we gain from engaging with technology professionals allow us to build products that solve well-understood IT management challenges in ways that technology professionals want them solved. We sell a comprehensive portfolio of Core IT Management products that are designed for ITOps, DevOps and IT security professionals. We also sell cloud-based software solutions purpose-built to enable managed service providers, or MSPs, to support digital transformation and growth within small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, around the world. Our approach, which we call the “SolarWinds Model,” enables us to market and sell our products directly to network and systems engineers, database administrators, storage administrators, DevOps and service desk professionals and MSPs. These technology professionals have become empowered to influence the selection, and often the purchase, of products needed to rapidly solve the problems they confront. We serve the entire IT market uniquely and efficiently with our SolarWinds Model. Technology professionals use our products in organizations ranging in size from very small businesses to large enterprises. Our products are designed to do the complex work of monitoring and managing networks, systems and applications across on-premises, cloud and hybrid IT environments without the need for customization or professional services. Many of our products are built on common technology platforms that enable our customers to easily purchase and deploy our products individually or as integrated suites as their needs evolve. We utilize a cost-efficient, integrated global product development model and have expanded our offerings over time through both organic development and strategic acquisitions. We market and sell our products directly to technology professionals primarily through a high-velocity, low-touch, digital marketing and direct inside sales approach that we call “selling from the inside.” We have built a highly flexible and analytics-driven marketing model designed to efficiently drive website traffic and high-quality leads. We also engage with both existing and prospective customers using our online communities such as THWACK and MSP Institute. These communities are designed to train and inform technology professionals about our products, keep us connected to them and provide network effects to amplify word-of-mouth marketing for our products. Our sales team uses a prescriptive approach designed to manage these leads and quickly sell our products pursuant to our standard pricing and contract terms. We do not utilize an outside sales force or provide professional services. Technology professionals often find our products when they are online searching for a solution to address a specific need and use our full-featured trials to experience our purpose-built, powerful and easy to use products in their own environments. These experiences often lead to initial purchases of one or more products and, over time, purchases of additional products and advocacy within both their organizations and their networks of technology professionals. We also extend our sales reach through our MSP customers, who provide IT management as a service and rely on our products to deploy, manage and secure the IT environments of their end customers. Our MSP customer base enables us to reach across a fragmented end market opportunity consisting of millions of SMEs around the world. We benefit from the addition of end customers served by our MSP customers, the proliferation of devices managed by those MSPs and the expansion of products used by those MSPs to provide managed services to their end customers. We grow with our MSP customers as they add new customers and deliver new or enhanced services based on our solutions and when their SME customers add devices and services. We have grown while maintaining high levels of operating efficiency. We derive our revenue from a combination of subscription revenue from the sale of our MSP, application performance management and IT service management, or ITSM products, and license and maintenance revenue from the sale of our on-premises network and IT operations management perpetual license products. Over time, we have significantly increased our subscription and maintenance revenue and intend to grow our revenue and cash flow by gaining new customers, increasing penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our international footprint, bringing new products to market and expanding into new markets through organic development and targeted acquisitions.

Company Overview NortonLifeLock has the largest Consumer Cyber Safety platform in the world, empowering nearly 80 million users in more than 150 countries. Our business is built around consumers, we are the trusted and number one top of mind brand in consumer Cyber Safety, according to the 2020 NortonLifeLock brand tracking study. Today’s world is increasingly digital, and this digital world has changed the way we live our lives every day. Between the massive shift to working and learning from home, and the ever-growing utility and opportunities to play and transact online, people’s digital lives have become the norm. With each new digital interaction comes increased risk for consumers, as cyber criminals look to take advantage of this accelerating trend. This is why we view ourselves as a trusted ally for our customers in a complex digital world and are committed to advancing our mission of protecting each element of their digital lives. We maintain a global, multi-channel direct acquisition and brand marketing program. This program is designed to grow our customer base by increasing brand awareness and understanding of our products and services, and maximizing our global reach to prospective customers. We help prevent, detect and restore potential damages caused by many cyber criminals. We also make it easy for consumers to find, buy and use our products and services. To this end, we sell subscription-based Cyber Safety solutions primarily direct-to-consumer through our Norton and Avira websites, and indirectly through partner relationships with retailers, telecom service providers, hardware original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and employee benefit providers. Most of our subscriptions are sold on either annual or monthly terms. As of April 2, 2021, we have nearly 80 million total users, which come from direct, indirect, and freemium channels. Of the total users, we have 23 million direct customers with whom we have a direct billing relationship, and we have 30 million free users. •Direct-to-consumer channel: We use advertising and direct response marketing to elevate our brand, attract new customers, and generate significant demand for our services. We have a direct billing relationship with these customers. •Indirect partner distribution channels: We use strategic and affiliate partner distribution channels to refer prospective customers to us and expand our reach to our partners’ and affiliates’ customer bases. We developed and implemented a global partner sales organization that targets new, as well as existing, partners to enhance our partner distribution channels. These channels include retailers, telecom service providers, hardware OEMs, and employee benefit providers. Physical retail and OEM partners represent a small portion of our distribution, which minimizes the impacts of supply chain disruptions. •Freemium channel: With the acquisition of Avira, we have expanded our go-to-market with a freemium channel. We use free versions of our products to reach the broadest set of customers globally and bring Cyber Safety to a larger audience, especially in international markets. The free solution offers a baseline of protection and presents premium functionalities based on the risk profile and device-type of the user. The user can choose to add specific premium features or upgrade to our Norton 360 integrated platform, at which point, becoming a member of our paid customer base. Seasonality As is typical for many consumer technology companies, portions of our business are impacted by seasonality. However, we believe the net impact to our business is limited. Seasonal behavior in orders primarily reflects consumer spending patterns where our fiscal third and fourth quarters are higher due to the holidays in our third quarter, as well as follow-on holiday purchases and the U.S. tax filing season in our fourth quarter. Revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because of our subscription business model and because a large portion of our in-period revenues are recognized ratably from our deferred revenue balance. Our Strategy Our strategy is focused on profitable growth, allowing consumers to experience Cyber Safety. To fuel our growth, our consumer-centric strategy is to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use integrated platform, which we have built in-house.

"ITEM 1. BUSINESS Business Overview What We Do Citrix is an enterprise software company focused on helping organizations deliver a consistent and secure work experience no matter where work needs to get done - in the office, at home, or in the field. We do this by delivering a digital workspace solution that gives each employee the resources and space they need to do their best work. Our Workspace solutions are complemented by our App Delivery and Security (formerly Networking) solutions, by delivering the applications and data employees need across any network with security, reliability and speed. Citrix believes that work is not a place -work is about business outcomes. We have helped organizations with digital transformation for many years. The challenges and complexities created by the proliferation of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based applications and the emergence of hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure environments are now combined with the realities brought upon by the global COVID-19 pandemic-realities such as long-term remote and flexible work models and an increased need for risk mitigation and business continuity. As a result, we believe organizations are accelerating their cloud and digital transformation plans to better position themselves to address these new challenges and embrace the opportunity that may arise from flexible work models. To do this, organizations may rely on Citrix solutions for business agility, employee productivity, security and compliance, as well as cost and efficiency. Citrix solutions are focused on employee empowerment and are designed to provide end-users with the simplicity of a common user experience while ensuring information technology, or IT, administrators are able to deliver applications and data with the security and controls necessary to protect the enterprise and its customers. Our Business Transformation Citrix's business is evolving in three distinct and interrelated ways: •Perpetual to Subscription: Our business model has shifted away from selling perpetual licenses towards subscription, or recurring contracts in the form of SaaS, on-premise term, and consumption-based agreements; •On-Premise to Cloud: As the share of applications and data continues to move rapidly from on-premise data centers to the cloud, our product development and engineering resources have increasingly focused on delivering cloud-based solutions; and •Point Products to Platform: Our offerings and our go-to-market activities are shifting away from selling individual point products towards our platform solution, in a tiered offering that provides us the ability to deliver a variety of value-enhancing modules to our customers in the future. Citrix was incorporated in Delaware on April 17, 1989. Proposed Acquisition of Wrike On January 16, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wrike, Inc.

The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both Citrix and Wrike, is expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We believe this acquisition will allow us to accelerate our strategy to build on and expand beyond the growing virtualization market by delivering a cloud-based digital workspace experience empowering all employees to securely access, collaborate, and execute work in the most effective way across any work channel, device or location. Solutions and Services We offer digital workspace solutions and services that enable companies to deliver a consistent work experience by providing secure and reliable access to the systems and information employees need to do their best work, no matter where work needs to get done - in the office, at home, or in the field.

"Item 1. Business Overview We anticipate, secure, and simplify the experience of doing business, transforming today and tomorrow.. We deliver four integrated and comprehensive solutions to our customers using our cloud platform, the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange: •Secure access to the internet and SaaS with Zscaler Internet Access or ZIA; •Secure access to internal applications with Zscaler Private Access or ZPA; •Management and enhancement of the user-to-application experience with Zscaler Digital Experience or ZDX; and •Protection for public cloud workloads, servers and internet of things, or IoT, devices with Zscaler Cloud Protection or ZCP. We were incorporated in 2007, during the early stages of cloud adoption and mobility, based on a vision that the internet would become the new corporate network as the cloud becomes the new data center. We predicted that with rapid cloud adoption and increasing workforce mobility, traditional perimeter security approaches would provide inadequate protection for users and data and an increasingly poor user experience. We pioneered a cloud platform, the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, that represents a fundamental shift in the architectural design and approach to networking and security. Enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud to achieve greater IT agility, a faster pace of innovation and lower costs. Organizations are increasingly relying on internet destinations for a range of business activities, adopting new external SaaS applications for critical business functions and moving their internally managed applications to the public cloud, IaaS or PaaS. Enterprise users now expect to be able to seamlessly access applications and data, wherever they are hosted, from any device, anywhere in the world. We believe these trends are indicative of the broader digital transformation agenda, as businesses increasingly succeed or fail based on their IT outcomes. We believe that securing the on-premises corporate network to protect users and data is becoming increasingly irrelevant in a cloud and mobile-first world where organizations depend on the internet, a network they do not control and cannot secure, to access critical applications that power their businesses. We pioneered a new approach that securely connects users, devices, and applications using business policies, regardless of the network. Our Zero Trust Exchange eliminates the need for traditional on-premises security appliances that are difficult to maintain and require compromises between security, cost and user experience. Our purpose-built, multi-tenant, distributed cloud platform incorporates the security functionality needed to enable users, applications, and devices to safely and efficiently utilize authorized applications and services based on an organization’s business policies. Before our Zero Trust Exchange, the corporate data center served as the central hub of IT security, with a physical network perimeter used to separate corporate users, devices and applications from the internet. Today, the network perimeter consists of appliances that have become fundamentally less effective as applications, data, users and devices rapidly move off the corporate network, making the notion of a corporate perimeter obsolete. In a world where more companies are shifting their most critical IT assets to the cloud, a zero trust architecture is required. Our architecture is vastly different from the traditional “hub-and-spoke” corporate network, where traffic from branch offices is routed to centralized data centers for security scanning and policy enforcement before reaching its destination. In contrast, our Zero Trust Exchange, which is distributed across more than 150 data centers worldwide, acts as an intelligent switchboard that uses business policies to securely connect users, devices, and applications over any network. We provide all of these solutions at scale, processing well over 160 billion internet requests per day. Our Zero Trust Exchange eliminates the need for organizations to buy and manage a variety of high cost appliances that need to be maintained by a large number of highly skilled security personnel, who are expensive and in increasingly short supply. Our cloud native, multitenant architecture is distributed across more than 150 data centers globally to bring security and business policy close to users and devices in 185 countries to provide fast, secure, and reliable access. Each day, we block over 150 million threats and perform over 200,000 unique security updates. Our customers benefit from the cloud security effect of our ever-expanding ecosystem because once a new threat is detected, it can be blocked across our entire customer base within minutes. Many of the largest enterprises and government agencies in the world rely on our solutions to help them accelerate their move to the cloud. We have over 5,600 customers across all major geographies, with an emphasis on larger organizations, and we currently count over 500 of the Forbes Global 2000 as customers. Our customers span every major industry, including financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, airlines and transportation, conglomerates, consumer goods and retail, media and communications, public sector and education, technology and telecommunications services. We have experienced significant growth, with revenue increasing from $302.8 million in fiscal 2019 to $431.3 million in fiscal 2020 to $673.1 million in fiscal 2021, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 42% and 56%, respectively. We experienced net losses of $28.7 million, $115.1 million and $262.0 million in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, respectively. We expect we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Our Solutions and Zero Trust Exchange Platform Our Zero Trust Exchange cloud security platform delivers four comprehensive and integrated solutions built natively in the cloud to power digital transformation.

Pareteum is a mission-focused company that seeks to empower “Every Person and Every(Thing)” to be globally connected, hence our slogan - ANY DEVICE, ANY NETWORK, ANYWHERE™. The Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, Enablers and Aggretators (“MVNO”, “MVNE” and “MVNA”), Smart Cities, and Application developer markets - each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications-Platform-as-a-Service (“CPaaS”), which Pareteum delivers. Coronavirus Pandemic In March 2020, the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) began spreading across the globe and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization; the President of the United States (“U.S.”) declared this a national emergency. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting social changes are not predictable. There are a number of uncertainties arising from COVID-19 that have impacted and could continue to impact our operating results: the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation measures, the duration of the pandemic, the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts, and the effect on global economic conditions. Likewise, business operational changes, work from home, school from home and shop from home all impact consumer confidence and the availability of supply chains to support these activities. We expect operating and financial results to continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 for the duration of the pandemic. We have seen an increase in usage consumption, particularly for messaging and consumer mobile services during the pandemic. However, our products and services for customers in the travel and hospitality industries have been and continue to be negatively impacted. We expect volatility in customer demand and consumption habits as the pandemic continues, and we may experience constrained supply or curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our operations. Specifically, we have seen slowing sales cycles, including customers and prospective customers delaying contracts or renewals. Customers in the pipeline are uncertain and may minimize commitments related to the products and services we offer. Innovative Use Cases Many sectors, from traditional network operators to disruptive technology and data-driven companies, have found many innovative use cases for our platforms. Beyond simply enabling communications between people and devices, the Company’s platforms are designed to enable any of the following, among others: • Smart homes, including smart appliances, smart energy meters, wearables etc. • Connected cars • Smart cities • Smart logistics and supply chains • Smart healthcare applications In addition to the foregoing, as a result of acquisitions completed in October 2018 and February 2019, the Company has acquired certain intellectual property portfolios (the “Acquired IP Rights”), which it now manages through various wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Company utilizes patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere to protect the Acquired IP Rights. Business Model At Pareteum, our mission is to “Empower Consumer Service Providers (“CSPs”), Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own wireless communications products and experience through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity.” We believe that open software and interfaces for communications services will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information. Our value proposition intersects with numerous applications and industries. It is our strong belief that no other company in the CPaaS market offers similarly broad value in such a comprehensive way. However, an easily accessible open mobility system for the world is challenging to scale because it requires a “network effect.” The network effect is the principle that a service yields increased value as it grows. The essence of this point is that our business and our services will grow in value as we grow and scale. We aim to achieve that growth by providing the marketplace exchange on which these communications and transactions take place, and in doing so we attract new users and more customers. To achieve our desired growth, we use our managed services solutions as a launching pad from which to grow our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform by offering Mobility, Engagement, Intelligence and Control products and services to our existing and prospective customers.

"Item 1. Business Unity is the world’s leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content. We believe the world is a better place with more creators in it. Creators, ranging from game developers to artists, architects, automotive designers, filmmakers, and others, use Unity to make their imaginations come to life. Our platform provides a comprehensive set of software solutions to create, run and monetize interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles, and augmented and virtual reality devices. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we had, on average, approximately 2.7 billion monthly active end users who consumed content created or operated with our solutions. The applications developed by these creators were downloaded, on average, five billion times per month in 2020. Content built on the Unity platform offers end-users a fundamentally more engaging and immersive experience than traditional static content. Content made with Unity is interactive, allowing end-users to connect with the content and with one another. Content made with Unity is real-time, allowing it to instantly adapt to end-user behavior and feedback. Content made with Unity allows graphics to be expressed with 3D shape and depth, permitting multiple viewing angles, and enabling augmented and virtual reality. Real-time is not just a part of the end-user experience. Building content on Unity offers creators significant advantages in development compared to traditional content creation tools. Creators can visualize and iterate on their 2D and 3D creations in real-time and collaborate with each other to edit content simultaneously. This can lead to significant reductions in design and development cycle times. The demand for interactive, real-time 3D content is expanding rapidly. Compute processors have become dramatically faster and more powerful. Improvements in bandwidth have enabled smartphones, PCs, consoles and other devices to connect at a global scale. Cloud computing has removed the limitations on processing power and storage to support content. These factors are driving significant increases in available compute power and are enabling the spread of immersive and interactive content. As a result, creators can now develop more intricate, higher fidelity experiences for end-users to enjoy on more devices and across larger connected communities. The gaming industry has benefited enormously from these enabling technologies with over 2.6 billion gamers driving the fastest growing sector in media today. Unity has built its reputation in gaming, and our scale and reach in this industry are significant. We estimate that in the fourth quarter of 2020, 71% of the top 1,000 mobile games were made with Unity. Unity’s platform helps game developers-from the largest publishers in the world with teams of hundreds, to mid-sized, small and independent publishers, to individual creators-build and operate high quality games, rapidly and efficiently. Unity games can be built once and deployed and operated across more than 20 platforms, including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and the leading augmented and virtual reality platforms, among others. As gaming has proliferated, the business models for content have evolved beyond one-time purchases to include advertising and in-app purchases. Unity enables these new business models by providing creators with the solutions they need to easily run and monetize their content. The dramatic growth of end-user demand for interactive content is driving industries beyond gaming to embrace the advantages of real-time 3D content. Creators are leveraging our platform to provide faster content creation and efficient deployment across formats and use cases. Today, Fortune and Global 500 companies in industries such as architecture, engineering, construction, automotive, transportation, manufacturing, film, television and retail are using Unity across many new use cases, including automobile and building design, online and augmented reality product configurators, autonomous driving simulation, and augmented reality workplace safety training. These new forms of content are emerging parts of our business and represent a significant opportunity for growth. Unity Software Inc. Our platform consists of two distinct, but connected and synergistic, sets of solutions. Our Create Solutions are used by content creators-developers, artists, designers, engineers, and architects-to create interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content. Our Operate Solutions offer customers the ability to grow and engage their end-user base, as well as run and monetize their content with the goal of optimizing end-user acquisition and operational costs while increasing the lifetime value of their end-users. We offer our Create Solutions primarily through monthly subscriptions and our Operate Solutions primarily through revenue-share and usage-based models. This allows us to generate revenue from our customers as they develop content and also as they succeed and grow. Subscriptions for our Create Solutions drive adoption of our Operate Solutions. We have experienced rapid growth. Our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $772.4 million, $541.8 million, and $380.8 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 43% and 42%, respectively. We generated net losses of $282.3 million, $163.2 million, and $131.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, which included $134.6 million, $44.5 million, and $20.9 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had $19.9 million net cash provided by operating activities and $67.9 million and $81.1 million net cash used in operating activities, respectively. The Future is Interactive, Real-Time 3D For almost a hundred years, photos and video content have largely been created by the same means-capturing three dimensional images through a 2D lens and projecting them onto a 2D surface. Technology has introduced digital cameras, lenses for capturing images at astonishing resolutions and powerful software tools that allow creators to edit and manipulate images with limitless possibilities. Still, the basic processes and technology related to content and content creation revolve around building 2D, asynchronous non-interactive, static content. The world is changing. Leaps forward in compute power and bandwidth are enabling an explosion in interactive, real-time 3D content-led by games and now spreading rapidly into other industries. We have moved from a static content world to one of lifelike, dynamic content-where 2D images are no longer projected to create video, but where fully interactive,...","Unity is the world’s leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content.

The SPS Commerce business model fundamentally changes how organizations use electronic communication to manage their omnichannel, supply chain, and other business requirements by replacing the collection of traditional, custom-built, point-to-point integrations with a model that facilitates a single automated connection to the entire SPS Commerce network of trading partners. From that single connection, a member of our network can make use of the full suite of our services, from fulfillment automation to the analysis and optimization of item sell-through performance, to sourcing new items, retailing relationships, logistics providers, or other services. These cloud services deliver value as stand-alone offerings but can also provide greater value when used collectively. This represents a fundamental change to fulfillment automation and enables inherent adaptability and flexibility not possible with traditional supply chain management system architectures. Our Fulfillment solution allows customers to comply with numerous rulebooks for retailers, grocers, and distributors. Maintaining current connections with retailers, grocers, and distributors removes the need for their trading partners to continually stay up-to-date with their required rulebook change. The utilization of a cloud services model eliminates (or greatly reduces) the burden on trading partners to support and maintain an on-premise software application, thereby reducing their ongoing operating costs. As the transaction hub for trading partners, we can provide increased performance visibility and data analytics capabilities across their supply chains, each of which is difficult to gain from traditional, point-to-point integration solutions. SPS COMMERCE, INC. Form 10-K for the Annual Period ended December 31, 2020 The following services are enabled through the SPS Commerce cloud-based Platform: • Fulfillment. The Fulfillment solution provides fulfillment automation and replaces or augments an organization’s existing staff and trading partner electronic communication infrastructure by enabling easy compliance with retailers’ rulebooks, automatic, digital exchange of information among numerous trading partners through various protocols, and greater visibility into the journey of an order. • Analytics. The Analytics solution consists of data analytics applications that enable our customers to improve their visibility across their supply chains through greater analytics capabilities. When focused on point-of-sale data, for example, retailers and suppliers can ensure inventory is located where demand is highest. Additionally, retailers improve their visibility into supplier performance and their understanding of product sell-through. • Other Solutions. We provide several peripheral solutions, such as our assortment solution (which enables accurate order management and rapid fulfillment) and our community solution (which accelerates vendor onboarding and ensures trading partner adoption of new supply chain requirements). Our Customer and Sales Sources As one of the largest providers of cloud services for retail supply chain management, the trading partner relationships that we enable among our retailer, supplier, grocer, distributor, and logistics customers naturally lead to new customer acquisition opportunities. “Network Effect” Once connected to our network, trading partners can exchange electronic supply chain information with each other. The value of our network increases with the number of trading partners connected to it. The addition of each new customer enables that new customer to communicate with our existing customers and permits our existing customers to do business with the new customer. Additionally, through our Sourcing solution, our community now has a social network focused on facilitating connections and business interactions among retailers and suppliers. This “network effect” of adding additional customers to our solutions’ infrastructure creates a significant opportunity for existing customers to realize incremental sales by working with our new trading partners and vice versa. As a result of this increased volume of activity among our network participants, we earn additional revenues from these participants. Business Development Efforts.

Overview Cadence is a leader in electronic design, building upon more than 30 years of computational software expertise. We apply our underlying Intelligent System Design™ strategy to deliver software, hardware and IP that turn design concepts into reality. Our customers include some of the world’s most innovative companies that deliver extraordinary electronic products from chips to boards to systems for dynamic market applications including consumer, hyperscale computing, 5G communications, mobile automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. Our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of integrated circuits (“ICs”), systems-on-chip (“SoCs”), and increasingly sophisticated electronic devices and systems. Our products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring our customers’ products to market, improving engineering productivity and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs. Our customers create and sell electronic products at differing levels of end-product completeness. Our electronic systems customers deliver entire devices, such as smartphones, laptop computers, gaming systems, automobiles and autonomous driving systems, servers, cloud data center infrastructure, artificial intelligence (“AI”) systems, aerospace and defense, medical equipment and networking products. These systems companies internally develop, or externally purchase, the sub-components for their products, including printed circuit boards (“PCBs”), which interconnect all the hardware components, ICs, which are often referred to as computer chips, and software at various levels which runs on the hardware. Our semiconductor customers deliver ICs, which include subcategories such as memory chips, SoCs, analog chips, processors and other types of chips. We offer software, hardware, services and reusable IC design blocks, which are commonly referred to as intellectual property (“IP”). Systems customers use our offerings to develop and integrate software that is key to the functionality and analysis of their products, as well as to design their ICs and PCBs. Our semiconductor customers use our offerings to design, configure, analyze and verify ICs. Additionally, some customers license our IP, which accelerates their product development processes by providing pre-designed and verified circuit blocks for their ICs. With our Intelligent System Design™ strategy, we provide the computational software technologies necessary for our electronic system and semiconductor customers to develop electronic products across a variety of vertical markets including consumer, hyperscale computing, mobile, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. We address the challenges posed by the needs and trends of electronic systems companies as well as semiconductor companies delivering greater portions of these systems. The development of electronic products, or their sub-components, is complex and requires many engineers using our solutions with specialized knowledge and skill. The rate of technical innovation in electronics is swift, long driven by a concept known as Moore’s Law, which more than 50 years ago predicted that the complexity of ICs would double approximately every 24 months. In order to make our customers successful, our products must handle this exponential growth rate in complexity, without requiring a corresponding increase in our customers’ costs. Historically, the industry that provided the tools used by IC engineers was referred to as Electronic Design Automation (“EDA”). Today, our offerings include and extend beyond core EDA to enable computational software for Intelligent System Design across three layers as illustrated below-starting with IC and SoC design excellence, followed by system innovation, and then pervasive intelligence. The IC and SoC design excellence requires technologies for custom IC, digital IC design and signoff, and functional verification, and leverages pre-built semiconductor IP. These tools, IP and associated services are specifically designed to meet the growing requirements of engineers designing increasingly complex chips across analog, digital and mixed-signal domains, and perform the associated verification tasks, including validation of low-level software running on the silicon model, thereby enabling design teams to manage complexity and verification throughput without commensurately increasing the team size or extending the project schedule, while reducing technical risks. The second layer of our strategy centers around system innovation. It includes tools and services used for system design of the packages that encapsulate the ICs and the PCBs, system simulation which includes electromagnetic, electro-thermal and other multi-physics analysis necessary as part of optimizing the full system’s performance, radio frequency (“RF”) and microwave systems, and embedded...","Cadence is a leader in electronic design, building upon more than 30 years of computational software expertise.

"Item 1. Business Overview Cloudflare’s mission is to help build a better Internet. In recent years, the technology industry has undergone a massive transition from on-premise hardware and software that customers buy, to services in the cloud that they rent. Organizations find themselves at different points in this transition to the cloud. Regardless of where organizations are in their transition, they all face a common set of challenges: they exist in a complex, heterogeneous infrastructure environment which exacerbates the fundamental problems of the Internet more than ever, and the on-premise hardware boxes that they once relied upon to solve these problems were never designed to work in such an environment. As more workloads move to the cloud, there is no point in installing additional hardware boxes on premise. An on-premise box will not solve the problems organizations now face. Nor can a business ship a hardware box to a cloud vendor. Even if they wanted to, there is literally no place to install such a box in the cloud. The result is that a major architectural shift at the network layer is now underway. Previously, enterprises would often string together a diverse set of on-premise hardware boxes from different vendors to solve their network challenges. As these solutions move to the cloud, the network latency, support complexity, and cost of overhead makes stringing together multiple point-cloud solutions that only address a specific network need untenable. Customers are therefore looking to consolidate behind a single global cloud services provider. Cloudflare is a global cloud services provider that delivers a broad range of services to businesses of all sizes and in all geographies-making them more secure, enhancing the performance of their business-critical applications, and eliminating the cost and complexity of managing individual network hardware. Our network serves as a scalable, easy-to-use, unified control plane to deliver security, performance, and reliability across on-premise, hybrid, cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. We serve comprehensive customer needs across security, performance, and reliability. As of December 31, 2020, more than 17% of the Fortune 1,000 were paying Cloudflare customers. Our Network We have built an efficient, scalable network that allows us to rapidly develop and deploy our products for our customers. We created a network architecture that is flexible, scalable, and gets more and more efficient as it expands. We designed and built our network to be able to grow capacity quickly and inexpensively; to allow for every server, in every city, to run nearly every Cloudflare service; and to allow us to shift customers and traffic across our network efficiently. We refer to this architecture as “serverless” because it means we can deploy standard, commodity hardware, and our product developers and customers do not need to worry about the underlying servers. Our software is designed to manage the deployment and execution of our product developers’ code and our customers’ code across our network. Because we manage the execution and prioritization of code running across our network, it means that we are both able to improve the performance of our highest paying customers, and also effectively leverage idle capacity across our network. We have chosen to utilize this idle capacity to create a free tier of service-which has generated substantial global scale for us. In turn, this scale makes us attractive partners for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) globally, which reduces our co-location and bandwidth costs. As our network grows, these dynamics become even more powerful. Today, our network spans more than 200 cities in over 100 countries worldwide and interconnects with over 9,100 networks globally, including major ISPs, cloud services, and enterprises. Growth Strategy Key elements of our growth strategy include: •Acquire New Customers: We believe that any person or business that relies on the Internet to deliver products, services, or content can be a Cloudflare customer. We plan to continue to grow our customer base across all of our offerings-free, pay-as-you-go, and contracted. ◦Free: We will continue to invest in awareness and functionality of our products to drive overall customer growth beyond the millions of Internet properties using Cloudflare today. ◦Pay-as-you-go and Contracted: We believe we have an opportunity to continue to grow our paying customer base, from small customers through to large contracted customers. In order to do this, we will continue to focus on growth in our pay-as-you-go channels by improving targeting and conversion as well as expanding our product offering. In addition, we intend to leverage our proven sales force to sell our products to larger contracted customers. •Expand Our Relationships with Existing Customers: Customers expand their relationships with us by upgrading to premium plans, increasing their usage of our products, or adding products. Once a customer has adopted one product on our platform, it can easily add additional products with a single click. •Develop New Products and Solutions: We continue to invest in new product development and building new solutions for our customers, and as we onboard more customers and more traffic on our network, our ability to identify promising new avenues for innovation improves. We have proven our ability to launch new products, having successfully brought many new products and product families to market. For example, in 2020 we announced a new suite of products called Cloudflare for Teams to protect the internal resources of organizations and more recently we announced our Cloudflare One solution that integrates many of our products to create a comprehensive security, performance, and reliability solution for our contracted customers. •Extend Our Serverless Platform Strategy: We have seen a growing number of customers that have chosen to bring applications to market using Cloudflare Workers. This has opened up an entirely new market for us: storage and compute. Our Cloudflare Workers offering is attractive in the market for reasons of our architecture and the power of our network, and we believe adoption of Cloudflare Workers will continue to grow as we further invest in it. Our Products We deliver a suite of deeply integrated products that serve as a unified control plane for our customers.

"Item 1. Business Overview We are a leading provider of networking solutions that enable next-generation networks focused on reliability, availability, scalability and cybersecurity. Our portfolio supports customers operating in the cloud, on-premise or in hybrid environments providing rapid return on their investment as well as investment protection with best-in-class technical performance. As cyber-attacks increase in volume and complexity, we integrate security as a key attribute in our solutions that further enable our customers to continue to adapt to market trends in cloud, internet of things and the ever increasing need for more data, building upon our strong global footprint and leadership in application and network infrastructure. Our customers include leading service providers (cloud, telecommunications, multiple system operators, cable), government organizations, and enterprises. Industry Trends & Market Drivers The digitization of business has made applications a critical ingredient in virtually every aspect of operations. How safely and efficiently applications perform determines how businesses perform, how they compete, grow, and stand out in the marketplace. The application networking and security industry is experiencing dynamic shifts in the way applications are developed, delivered, monetized and protected. Our corporate strategy and technology address these evolving needs of our customers and industry, including: Increased Adoption of Cloud Applications. For decades, businesses operated with applications based in physical, appliance-based data centers. While these traditional applications remain central to businesses around the world, a new genre of cloud-based applications is emerging, presenting new opportunities and challenges that require organizations to reassess the visibility, performance and security of their applications. Some of these challenges relate to how a business effectively manages secure application services across various data centers and cloud types - whether private, public or hybrid clouds. Over time, more and more applications may be born in the cloud, while some applications that existed in traditional data centers may migrate to clouds as well. To address this shift, businesses will need solutions that bridge both traditional and cloud-based application environments and centrally manage all secure application services holistically in this multi-cloud world. Increased Network Complexity and New Infrastructure Paradigms. Traditional IT vendors may need to shift from hardware-centric models to software-defined approaches to improve agility for critical applications, and subsequently, their business operations. Ensuring product portfolios adapt and diversify to include newer virtualized software, container based software and cloud-based offerings are key factors determining future market leadership and competitive landscapes. Growing Importance of Automation and Orchestration. As applications increasingly move to a multi-cloud environment, the deployment of orchestration and automation tools has become essential to efficiently automating the deployment and operations of security and application services. There is a need for increased operational efficiency and agility, improved detection and reporting of security anomalies, enhanced end-user experiences and reduced total cost of ownership (“TCO”), simplified management of distributed application services, improved capacity planning and optimized multi-cloud software lifecycle management. By deploying newly developed secure application delivery automation and predictive analytics tools, enterprises are able to visualize their application performance, detect anomalous trends and fully automate their application delivery and network security. The Rise of DDoS Attacks. The cyberthreat landscape continues to intensify and grow. Malicious actors and cybercriminals such as hacktivists, amateur hackers, and foreign military and intelligence organizations target data centers of every type. Distributed Denial of Service (“DDoS”) attacks are increasing in size, frequency, complexity and notoriety. IT defenders are faced with the increasing sophistication of adversaries who are responsible for the size and frequency of these attacks. A DDoS attack seeks to render a target network or website unavailable by orchestrating coordinated attacks from massive worldwide networks of compromised endpoints, called botnets. Compromised endpoints can be computing devices or “Internet of Things” driven devices like video cameras. Any internet-connected device can be vulnerable to hackers and utilized as part of a botnet. Rapid growth of TLS, SSL, Encrypted Applications and Hidden Threats. Many applications use Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) and Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) protocols. Cyber criminals exploit the protocol to hide malicious malware within encrypted channels and carry out attacks against businesses and users. This malicious trend drives demand for greater visibility within SSL-encrypted channels. Businesses need a way to decrypt traffic and apply outbound security policies efficiently, and require an effective way to inspect, identify, and remediate malicious traffic, then re-encrypt traffic and deliver it quickly to its destination. Conducting this process efficiently without placing a “security performance tax” on the user experience is a critical requirement. The Advent of 5G Networks and a Smart World. The growing deployment of commercial 5G networks will bring massive increases in network throughput and significant new business opportunities for mobile carriers. It will also require a new generation of security infrastructure capable of handling the growing capacity requirements and complex management needs of 5G networks. Capacity requirements increase dramatically in 5G networks due to substantial increases in concurrent sessions, lower packet size and higher connections per second. Operators must dramatically lower latency, reduce total cost of ownership, and improve efficiency which may require advanced consolidation of network functions at the core. Meanwhile, the scope and size of DDoS attacks may also increase dramatically with the proliferation of connected devices and traffic, due in large part to the expansion of Internet of Things (“IoT”)/Machine-to-Machine traffic coming from new 5G-delivered Smart World applications. To address these requirements, mobile operators will need new solutions that provide hyperscale and increased performance, richer feature sets, and rich automation, analytics and threat intelligence. Need for Advanced Multi-Cloud Secure Application Service Solutions. To address these challenges, advanced and integrated solutions for managing secure application services across businesses’ application environments are needed. Of the many solution requirements, some of the more critical include: •Ability to Centrally Manage Traditional and Cloud Environments. As more applications are born in the cloud, and they operate alongside traditional applications supported by on-premise and appliance-based data centers, application delivery and security solutions will be called upon to span traditional and cloud-based environments. In doing so, solutions must centrally control and manage secure application services across any combination of traditional...","We are a leading provider of networking solutions that enable next-generation networks focused on reliability, availability, scalability and cybersecurity.

"Item 1.Business Overview and Purpose Guidewire delivers a leading platform that Property and Casualty (“P&C”) insurers trust to engage, innovate, and grow efficiently. Guidewire’s platform combines core operations, digital engagement, analytics, and artificial intelligence (“AI”) applications delivered as a cloud service or self-managed software. As a partner to our customers, we continually evolve to enable their success and assist them in navigating a rapidly changing insurance market. Our core operational services and products are InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud, InsuranceNow, and InsuranceSuite for self-managed installations. These services and products are transactional systems of record that support the entire insurance lifecycle, including insurance product definition, distribution, underwriting, policyholder services, and claims management. InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud is a highly configurable and scalable product, delivered as a service and primarily comprised of three core applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) that can be subscribed to separately or together. These applications are built on and optimized for our Guidewire Cloud Platform (“GWCP”) architecture and leverage our in-house Guidewire Cloud operations team. InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud is designed to support multiple releases each year to ensure that cloud customers remain on the latest version and gain fast access to our innovation efforts. Additionally, InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud embeds digital and analytics capabilities natively into our platform. Most new sales and implementations are for InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud. InsuranceNow is a complete, cloud-based application that offers policy, billing, and claims management functionality to insurers that have limited internal information technology resources. InsuranceSuite for self-managed installations is comprised of three core applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) that can be licensed separately or together and can be deployed and updated by our customers and their implementation partners. Our digital engagement applications enable digital sales, omni-channel service, and enhanced claims experiences for policyholders, agents, vendor partners, and field personnel. Our Analytics and AI offerings enable insurers to manage data more effectively, gain insights into their business, drive operational efficiencies, and underwrite new and evolving risks. To support P&C insurers globally, we have localized, and will continue to localize, our platform for use in a variety of international regulatory, language, and currency environments. Our customers range from some of the largest global insurance companies or their subsidiaries to predominantly national or local insurers that serve specific states and/or regions. Our customer engagement is led by our direct sales team and supported by our system integrator (“SI”) partners. We maintain and continue to grow our sales and marketing efforts globally, and maintain regional sales centers throughout the world. Because our platform is critical to our new and existing customers’ businesses, their decision-making and product evaluation process is long, which results in an extended sales cycle. These evaluation periods can extend further if a customer purchases multiple services and products or assesses the benefits of a cloud-based subscription. Sales to new customers also involve extensive customer due diligence and reference checks. The success of our sales efforts relies on continued improvements and enhancements to our current services and products, the introduction of new services and products, efficient operation of our cloud infrastructure, continued development of relevant local content and automated tools for updating content, and successful implementations. We sell our cloud-delivered offerings through subscription services and our self-managed products through term licenses. We generally price our services and products based on the amount of direct written premium (“DWP”) that will be managed by our platform. Our subscription, term license, and support fees are typically invoiced annually in advance. Subscription services are generally sold with an initial term of between three and five years with optional annual renewals commencing after the initial term. Subscription revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the committed term, once all revenue recognition criteria is met including providing access to the service. Term licenses are primarily sold with an initial two-year committed term with optional annual renewals commencing after the initial term. We may enter into term license arrangements with our customers that have an initial term of more than two years or may renew license arrangements for longer than one year. A small portion of our revenue is derived from perpetual licenses. Term and perpetual license revenue are typically recognized when software is made available to a customer, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our support revenue is generally recognized ratably over the committed support term of the licensed software. Our support fees are typically priced as a fixed percentage of the associated license fees. We also offer professional services, both directly and through SI partners, to help our customers deploy, migrate, and utilize our services, products, and platform. Substantially all of our services revenue is billed monthly on a time and materials basis. We began our principal business operations in 2001. Industry Background The P&C insurance industry is large, fragmented, highly regulated, and complex. It is also highly competitive, with insurers competing primarily on product differentiation, pricing options, customer service, marketing and advertising, affiliate programs, and channel strategies. P&C insurers modernize their transactional core systems to manage key functional areas of P&C insurance, including product definition, underwriting and policy administration, claims management, and billing. Product definition specifies the insurance coverage, pricing, and financial and legal terms of insurance policies. Underwriting and policy administration includes collecting information from potential policyholders, determining appropriate coverages and terms, pricing policies, issuing policies, and updating and maintaining policies over their lifetimes. Claims management includes loss intake, investigation and evaluation of incidents, settlement negotiation, vendor management, litigation management, and payment processing. Billing includes policyholder invoicing, payment collection, and agent commission calculation. We believe insurers that adopt modern core systems can enhance customer experience, operate more efficiently, and introduce innovative services and products more rapidly. We believe the P&C insurance industry is experiencing accelerating change in how insurers engage with, sell to, and manage relationships with individual and business customers. Today, P&C insurers are striving to respond to significant changes in their competitive marketplace and the character of the risks they underwrite. The most significant changes include: •an industry...","Guidewire delivers a leading platform that Property and Casualty (“P&C”) insurers trust to engage, innovate, and grow efficiently.

Part I Item 1. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS General theglobe.com, inc. (the “Company,” “theglobe,” “we” or “us”) was incorporated on May 1, 1995 and commenced operations on that date. Originally, we were an online community with registered members and users in the United States and abroad. On September 29, 2008, we consummated the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of our subsidiary, Tralliance Corporation (“Tralliance”), to Tralliance Registry Management Company, LLC (“Tralliance Registry Management”), an entity controlled by Michael S. Egan, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result of and on the effective date of the sale of our Tralliance business, which was our last remaining operating business, we became a “shell company,” as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, with no material operations or assets. On December 20, 2017, Delfin Midstream LLC (“Delfin”) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with certain of our stockholders for the purchase of a total of 312,825,952 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), representing approximately 70.9% of our Common Stock. As a shell company, our operating expenses have consisted primarily of, and we expect them to continue to consist primarily of, customary public company expenses, including personnel, accounting, financial reporting, legal, audit and other related public company costs. As of December 31, 2020, as reflected in our accompanying Balance Sheet, our current liabilities exceed our total assets. We prefer to avoid filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. However, unless we are successful in raising additional funds through the offering of debt or equity securities, we may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern for any significant length of time in the future. Notwithstanding the above, we currently intend to continue operating as a public company and make all the requisite filings under the Exchange Act. EMPLOYEES As of March 1, 2021, we had no employees.

"Item 1. BUSINESS Overview Our mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure. We provide a video-first unified communications platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people interact. We connect people through frictionless and secure video, phone, chat, and content sharing and enable face-to-face video experiences for thousands of people in a single meeting across disparate devices and locations. Our cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-quality video and voice that is easy to use, manage, and deploy; provides an attractive return on investment; is scalable and easily integrates with physical spaces and applications. We believe that rich and reliable communications lead to interactions that build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the trust our customers place in us by delivering a communications solution that “just works.” The cornerstone of our platform is Zoom Meetings, around which we provide a full suite of products and features designed to give users an easy, reliable, and innovative unified communications experience. Users are comprised of both hosts who organize video meetings and the individual attendees who participate in those video meetings. In 2019, we launched Zoom Phone, a cloud-based PBX system, creating a unique unified communications platform. Many customers also choose to implement Zoom Rooms, our software-based conference room system, which enables users to easily experience Zoom Meetings in their physical meeting spaces. Our partner ecosystem, which includes App Marketplace and in-product apps, and developer platform help enterprises create elevated experiences with third-party applications to create customized workflows. The happiness we bring is recognized by customers. Zoom has consistently high scores across customer review sites, including Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, and G2 Crowd, including being recognized as a 2020 Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice for Meeting Solutions and a TrustRadius Top Rated Web Conferencing Software. Industry analysts also recognize our market leadership: Gartner has named Zoom a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for Meeting Solutions based on our “ability to execute” and “completeness of vision.” In 2020 we also became a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for UCaaS. Frost & Sullivan recognized Zoom with its Global Connected Work Company of the Year award in 2020, as well as awards for Global Video Communications in The COVID-19 Crisis Enabling Technology Leadership, Asia-Pacific Cloud Video Collaboration Services Company of The Year, and Indian Cloud Video Enabling Technology Leadership. We have a unique model that combines viral enthusiasm for our platform with a multipronged go-to-market strategy for optimal efficiency. Viral enthusiasm begins with our users as they experience our platform - it just works. This enthusiasm continues as meeting participants become paid hosts and as businesses of all sizes become our customers. Our sales efforts funnel this viral demand into routes-to-market that are optimized for each customer opportunity, which can include our direct sales force, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners. Our Growth Strategy We focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth: •Keep our existing customers happy. We provide happiness to our customers by giving them an experience that delights them. We respond to customer needs with action to drive positive user experiences. We believe these practices result in our high scores across customer review sites and will continue to generate referrals from our existing customers, providing meaningful viral adoption for the foreseeable future. •Drive new customer acquisition. Our platform is designed to make it easy to host meetings. By attracting free hosts to use our platform, we promote usage that allows hosts and their meeting attendees to experience the difference of Zoom. We complement this lead-generation model with our multipronged go-to-market strategy that integrates the viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal routes-to-market, including direct sales representatives, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners. This approach allows us to cost-effectively drive upgrades to our paid offering and expansion within organizations of all sizes and verticals. •Expand within existing customers. As organizations experience our video platform and become familiar with its benefits, more teams and departments within these organizations adopt Zoom. Our platform may begin in a line of business and then organically expand across departments. This “land and expand” model has led to some of our largest deployments. Customers are also purchasing services for webinars, room solutions, and phone for the full Zoom Unified Communications as a Service (“UCaaS”) experience. •Innovate our platform continuously. Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of video communication and collaboration technologies. We strive to deliver the best experience to our users by dedicating a portion of engineering capacity to developing on-demand, customer-requested features that would be valuable across our customer base. •Accelerate international expansion. With users, offices, and data centers strategically located around the world, we are poised to reach new customers globally. Our platform is intuitively designed such that localization requirements are minimal. For example, our platform works without intensive translation requirements with only a few language adjustments to our user interface and support systems. •Grow our partnership ecosystem and continue to expand our platform. Our platform integrates easily with other systems and tools.

"Item 1. Business. Overview Bsquare is a software and services company that designs, configures, and deploys technologies that solve difficult problems for manufacturers and operators of connected devices. Our customers choose Bsquare to help realize the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) to transform their businesses. Our products include software that connect devices to create intelligent systems that are cloud-enabled, contribute critical data, and facilitate distributed control and decision making. Our services include 24/7 IoT operations that allow our customers to focus on their businesses while we take care of security, monitoring, and general technology updates. The opportunity to help companies explore and capture the value of IoT is attractive and growing. In the last two years alone, we helped hundreds of companies deploy and manage over two million devices. We operate large IoT systems for our customers with device fleets that range in size and complexity. We believe we offer a unique combination of expertise in device-level solutions, embedded operating systems, and IoT services and software that is valued by a global customer base, from start-ups to Fortune 100 companies, across a diverse set of industries. Since our founding in 1994, Bsquare has been at the intersection of hardware and software. Today, that intersection is the “edge” where cloud-enabled devices connect to create intelligent systems, creating new demands for software, deployment, and operations. Bsquare is meeting those demands, making intelligent systems possible. We believe our technology is making people more productive, improving quality of life, and reducing demands on the resources of our planet. Embedded Operating System Software and Services Customers engage us because of our technical expertise in device operating system (“OS”) image development and configuration, device software development and testing, and our experience in embedded and mobile systems design. Our long and successful history as a Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) embedded OS distribution and technology partner is a source of many customer opportunities and a pillar of our reputation in the IoT ecosystem. We believe working with Bsquare engineers can result in shorter development cycles, faster time-to-market, lower overall development costs, and a more robust product. Our software and configuration services are designed to help ensure that our customers’ devices are secure, updateable, and operable as part of a connected IoT system. A decade ago, our customers typically built devices on a single OS. Today, they increasingly have a multi-OS product strategy. Accordingly, we believe that the need for our embedded OS expertise and services is expanding and accelerating. We recognize revenue and cost of sales for this segment of our business under the name “Partner Solutions”. Embedded OS Market Our target market for OS software and services includes makers of connected, intelligent devices such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, smart vending machines, ATMs, essential equipment in buildings and facilities environments, digital signs, and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices. These devices work on a variety of operating systems, including the most common: Windows IoT, Android, and Linux. They are deployed in various cloud environments, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), or Google Cloud, and are typically connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection. Our customers for these smart devices include world-class original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), original design manufacturers (“ODMs”), silicon vendors, and peripheral vendors. IoT Software and 24/7 Operations Services Our customers’ devices are frequently components of complicated operating networks, creating new requirements for updating, maintaining and evolving the capabilities of devices in the fleet. Once configured and deployed, this device fleet then becomes part of an operational environment that requires long-term attention to the myriad challenges of IoT operations. In short, devices can no longer simply be sold, installed, and then forgotten. These demands have created operational burdens that are challenging to meet through traditional technologies and support models. For that reason, our customers are increasingly relying on Bsquare’s extensive experience developing, deploying, and operating large IoT systems at scale. Our experience using Microsoft Azure and AWS cloud services is an asset we believe to be seldom found inside a customer’s technology team. We believe outsourcing fleet management and 24/7 operations services to Bsquare can result in lower system development costs, greater security, better maintainability, lower operating costs, and improved return on investment (“ROI”) for a customer’s IoT system. We have built and now operate 24/7 mission critical IoT systems for customers of varying size and complexity, and we believe the software and processes we have used to achieve this success may be a sustainable competitive advantage and a potential opportunity for new revenue. We recognize revenue and cost of sales for this segment of our business under the name “Edge to Cloud”. IoT Software and Services Market Our target market for our IoT software and services includes our OS and software OEM customers as well as companies that purchase from those OEMs and operate their devices as a fleet. This market represents business and industrial segments in a wide range of vertical markets such as retail, point of sale, medical equipment, gaming, buildings and facilities management, manufacturing, robotics, autonomous vehicles, utility management, and transportation. The IoT market continues to evolve as companies understand the possibilities and economics of IoT technology and operations. Increasingly, customers are realizing that IoT operations are not core competencies of their business and that outsourcing operations can lower costs, reduce downtime, and mitigate the reputational risk of security and operational failures. Bsquare Solutions Suite We provide a suite of software, tools, and services to our customers that are packaged based on technical and business requirements that includes: Embedded OS and System Software Sales and Support Bsquare resells Windows IoT, Windows Embedded, and Windows Server IoT software as well as system utility software for Adobe and McAfee. We provide license compliance services, technical support, and manufacturing support.

We have experienced strong revenue growth since we released our first solution in March 2010. Our revenue increased from $244.3 million in 2018 to $351.6 million in 2020, representing a 20% compound annual growth rate. We incurred net losses of $50.1 million in 2018, $47.5 million in 2019 and $48.4 million in 2020. Approximately 84% of our revenue in 2020 was derived from subscription and support fees, with the remainder from professional services. Macro Trends We designed our cloud-based collaboration platform to simplify complex work, supporting both remote and hybrid work environments. Four macro trends have been driving demand for Workiva's solutions: the shift to the cloud; digital transformation; increasing interest in remote and hybrid work environments; and increasing use of machine-readable data. Shift to the Cloud. Enterprises around the world have been shifting deployment of data management systems from on-premises to the cloud. A shift to the cloud started more than two decades ago with CRM and other front-office systems. In the last 10 years, enterprises also began adopting the cloud for managing middle- and back-office systems, owing to advantages in data security, data accessibility and total cost of operation. In its report “Forecast: Public Cloud Services, Worldwide, 2018-2024, 3Q20 Update,” Gartner estimates that worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services will grow 18.4% to a total of $304.9 billion in 2021. Digital Transformation. The economic benefits to enterprises of optimizing processes and transforming data to a digital environment are so compelling that the largest IT consulting firms in the world have built substantial advisory practices devoted to digital transformation. These consulting practices deliver business process reengineering, as well as technology selection and integration services. In its report “IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Digital Transformation 2021 Predictions,” IDC estimates direct, digital transformation investment will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15.5% from 2020 to 2023 and approach a total of $6.8 trillion. Remote and Hybrid Work Environments. To attract and retain talent in the marketplace of knowledge workers, enterprises are responding to pressure to adopt more flexible work environments. In an online survey conducted in May 2020, staffing firm Robert Half found that 60% of professionals who had transitioned to remote work said they have better work/life balance and that 74% of respondents would like to continue to telecommute more after pandemic restrictions are eased. Companies that manage a growing number of digital workplace employees are implementing collaborative technologies to streamline work processes and automate decision-making, actions and responses. Use of Machine-Readable Data. Regulators are demanding greater use of structured, machine-readable data in companies’ disclosures. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that public companies include “structured financial data” in filed annual and quarterly reports so that investors can automate extraction of data for analysis. The SEC implemented its structured data mandate by requiring companies to tag data in their financial statements using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), which is a royalty-free, international standard designed specifically for digital reporting of financial, performance, risk and compliance information. XBRL provides a unique, machine-readable tag for individual disclosures within business reports. Use of XBRL enables government agencies to automate screening and analysis of filed documents. For example, the SEC’s Division of Enforcement has integrated the analysis of XBRL data into its investigative processes. In 2019, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) revised its electronic filing format to incorporate structured data in XBRL. As a result, at least 200 electric utility, natural gas, oil pipeline and centralized service companies will be required to file quarterly and annual reports using XBRL in 2021. Fifty-two countries have issued 147 mandates for XBRL, and we expect use of the standard to continue to grow. The SEC now requires foreign private issuers that prepare their financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to include XBRL tagging in their SEC filings. In addition, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) now mandates Inline XBRL for its European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) regulation. Inline XBRL is a standard that embeds XBRL in financial statements, thus eliminating the need to file separate HTML and XBRL documents. Growth Vectors We are focusing investment on five growth opportunities: international markets, global statutory reporting, integrated risk, the U.S. government and partnerships. International Markets. We believe international growth presents an attractive opportunity because the factors that drive demand for our solutions in the United States are similar to those in other developed...","Workiva simplifies complex work for thousands of organizations worldwide.

Virtual assistants built with our platform can enable a wide variety of modes of human-vehicle interaction, including speech, touch, handwriting, gaze tracking and gesture recognition, and can support the integration of third-party virtual assistants into the in-vehicle experience. Our software platform is a market leader for building integrated, branded and differentiated virtual assistants for automobiles. As a unified platform and common interface for automotive cognitive assistance, our software platform provides OEMs and suppliers with an important control point with respect to the mobility experience and their brand value. Our platform is fully customizable and designed to support our customers in creating their own ecosystem in the automobile and transforming the vehicle into a hub for numerous connected devices and services. Virtual assistants built with our software platform can address user requests across a wide variety of categories, such as navigation, control, media, communication and tools. Our software platform is comprised of edge computing and cloud-connected software components and a software framework linking these components together under a common programming interface. We implement our software platform for our customers through our professional services organization, which works with OEMs and suppliers to optimize our software for the requirements, configurations and acoustic characteristics of specific vehicle models. The market for automotive cognitive assistance is rapidly expanding. The proliferation of smartphones and smart speakers has encouraged consumers to rely on a growing number of virtual assistants and special-purpose bots for various tasks such as controlling entertainment systems and checking the news. Automobile drivers and passengers increasingly expect hands-free access to virtual assistants as part of the mobility experience, with common use cases in a variety of categories including mobility domains such as navigation, voice-activated texts, and telephone communication, automobile domains, such as automobile user guides, and ignition on-off, and generic domains, such as entertainment. To meet the increasing demand for automotive cognitive assistance and to offer differentiated mobility experiences, OEMs and suppliers are building proprietary virtual assistants into an increasing proportion of their vehicles. We believe that this trend will continue and that consumer appetite for automotive cognitive assistance will grow further as vehicles become more autonomous and drivers pursue new forms of human-vehicle engagement previously not feasible during vehicle operation. We generate revenue primarily by selling software licenses and cloud-connected services. In addition, we generate professional services revenue from our work with OEMs and suppliers during the design, development and deployment phases of the vehicle model lifecycle and through maintenance and enhancement projects. Through our over 20 years in the automotive industry, we have developed longstanding industry relationships and benefit from incumbency. We have existing relationships with all major OEMs or their tier 1 suppliers, and while our customer contracts vary, they generally represent multi-year engagements, giving us visibility into future revenue. We have master agreements or similar commercial arrangements in place with many of our customers, supporting customer retention over the long term. As of September 30, 2021, we had fixed backlog of $336.4 million, which includes $276.7 million of estimated future revenue related to remaining performance obligations and $59.7 million of contractual commitments which have not yet been invoiced. As of September 30, 2021, we had variable backlog of $1.7 billion, which includes estimated future revenue from variable forecasted royalties related to our embedded and connected businesses. Our estimation of forecasted royalties is based on our royalty rates for embedded and connected technologies from expected car shipments under our existing contracts over the term of the programs. Anticipated shipments are based on historical shipping experience and current customer projections that management believes are reasonable as of the date of this Form 10-K. Both our embedded and connected technologies are priced and sold on a per-vehicle or device basis, where we receive a single fee for either or both the embedded license and the connected service term. However, our fixed and variable backlog may not be indicative of our actual future revenue. The revenue we actually recognize is subject to several factors, including the number and timing of vehicles our customers ship, potential terminations or changes in scope of customer contracts, and currency fluctuations. As of September 30, 2021, we estimate our total backlog to be $2.0 billion, including $336.4 million of fixed backlog and $1.7 billion of variable backlog. Our solutions have been installed in more than 400 million automobiles to date, including over 40 million new vehicles in fiscal 2021 alone.

"ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview Slack is the leading channels-based messaging platform, used by millions to align their teams, unify their systems, and drive their businesses forward. Slack offers a secure, enterprise-grade environment that can scale with the largest organizations in the world. It is a new layer of the business technology stack where people can work together more effectively, connect all their other software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work. Slack is where work happens. The most helpful explanation of Slack is often that it replaces the use of email inside the organization. Like email (or the Internet or electricity), Slack has very general and broad applicability. It is not aimed at any one specific purpose, but nearly anything that people do together at work. Slack is used to review job candidates, coordinate election coverage, diagnose network problems, negotiate budgets, plan marketing campaigns, approve menus, and organize disaster response teams, along with countless other tasks. Unlike email, however, most of this activity happens in team-based channels, rather than in individual inboxes. Channels offer a persistent record of the conversations, data, documents, and application workflows relevant to a project or a topic. Membership of a channel can change over time as people join or leave a project or organization, and users benefit from the accumulated historical information in a way an employee never could when starting with an empty email inbox. Depending on the size of the organization, this might provide tens, hundreds, or even thousands of times more access to information than is available to individuals working in environments where email is the primary means of communication. Slack also enables communication and collaboration among organizations via shared channels and guest accounts, and the associated network effect increases the value of Slack both for organizations on Slack and organizations new to Slack. Also unlike email, Slack was designed from the ground up to integrate with external software systems. Slack provides an easy way for users to share and aggregate information from other software, take action on notifications, and advance workflows in a multitude of third-party applications, over 2,450 of which are listed in the Slack App Directory. Further, Slack’s platform capabilities extend beyond integrations with third-party applications and allow for easy integrations with an organization’s internally-developed software. Developers have collectively created more than 850,000 third-party applications or custom integrations that were used in a typical week during the three months ended January 31, 2021. In 2019, we introduced Workflow Builder, a low-code solution to create integrations and workflows entirely in Slack, suitable for all users and based on a simple, non-technical user interface. Ultimately, Slack is more than email replacement. It is a new layer of the business technology stack that brings together people, applications, and data. Just as an operating system coordinates the flow of information and resources of a computer in a centralized fashion, using Slack inside an organization and across organizations creates a hub into which critical business information flows, is acted upon and transformed, and is then quickly routed to its desired destination. Slack streamlines our users’ workflows, increases the beneficial return on the time they spend communicating, and creates a powerful point of leverage for increased productivity. Summary of Key Benefits Working in Slack provides several key benefits to users, teams, and organizations and to our platform ecosystem: •People love using Slack and that leads to high levels of engagement. Slack is enterprise software created with an eye for user experience usually associated with consumer products. We believe that the more simple, enjoyable, and intuitive the product is, the more people will want to use it. As a result, teams benefit from the aggregated attention that happens when all members of a team are engaged in a single collaboration tool. •Slack increases an organization’s “return on communication.” Moving to channel-based communication increases accessibility of communication, which in turn increases transparency and breaks down silos. The organization benefits from increased coordination and alignment from a given amount of communication, with no additional effort in the form of status reports, update meetings, and so on. •Slack increases the value of existing software investment. As a flexible platform for routing information of all kinds, Slack integrates horizontally with thousands of other applications, from those provided by companies like Google, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Atlassian, and Dropbox to the proprietary line-of-business applications developed by organizations for their own internal use. Integration with Slack increases both the accessibility of information inside applications and the response times for many basic actions. Because Slack users can do virtually everything on Slack on mobile that they can do on desktop, they do not need to have dozens of work applications on their mobile devices to be able to make lightweight use of those applications on the go. •An organization’s archive of data increases in value over time. As teams continue to use Slack, they build a valuable resource of widely accessible information. Important messages are surrounded by useful context and users can see how fellow team members created and worked with the information and arrived at a decision. New employees can have instant access to the information they need to be effective whenever they join a new team or company. Finally, the content on Slack is available through powerful search and discovery tools, powered by machine learning, which improve through usage. •Slack helps organizations improve culture and employees’ feelings of empowerment. When every member of a team learns from, and contributes towards, common goals, people feel they have greater influence over the ultimate outcomes of their work. By keeping all team members in the information flow, we believe that Slack increases this sense that members of a team can have an impact and make a difference and that creates greater team cohesion and increases motivation. •Slack helps achieve organizational agility. Slack’s channels immerse workers directly into the dynamic and evolving communication, decision making, and data flow that defines modern work. Because workers have both more access to data...","Slack is the leading channels-based messaging platform, used by millions to align their teams, unify their systems, and drive their businesses forward. Slack offers a secure, enterprise-grade environment that can scale with the largest organizations in the world. It is a new layer of the business technology stack where people can work together more effectively, connect all their other software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work. The most helpful explanation of Slack is often that it replaces the use of email inside the organization. It is not aimed at any one specific purpose, but nearly anything that people do together at work. Slack is used to review job candidates, coordinate election coverage, diagnose network problems, negotiate budgets, plan marketing campaigns, approve menus, and organize disaster response teams, along with countless other tasks. Unlike email, however, most of this activity happens in team-based channels, rather than in individual inboxes. Channels offer a persistent record of the conversations, data, documents, and application workflows relevant to a project or a topic. Membership of a channel can change over time as people join or leave a project or organization, and users benefit from the accumulated historical information in a way an employee never could when starting with an empty email inbox. Depending on the size of the organization, this might provide tens, hundreds, or even thousands of times more access to information than is available to individuals working in environments where email is the primary means of communication. ","Slack is a channels-based messaging platform that replaces email inside organizations. It offers a secure, enterprise-grade environment that can scale with the largest organizations in the world. Slack enables communication and collaboration among organizations via shared channels and guest accounts, and the associated network effect increases the value of Slack both for organizations on Slack and organizations new to Slack. Slack was designed from the ground up to integrate with external software systems, providing an easy way for users to share and aggregate information from other software, take action on notifications, and advance workflows in a multitude of third-party applications.",0.2677824226018452,0.964306527072368
"Item 1. Business Overview MicroStrategy® pursues two corporate strategies in the operation of its business. One strategy is to grow our enterprise analytics software business and the other strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin. MicroStrategy is a global leader in enterprise analytics software and services. Since our founding in 1989, MicroStrategy has been focused on empowering organizations to leverage the immense value of their data. Our vision is to enable Intelligence Everywhere™ by delivering world-class software and services that empower enterprise users with actionable intelligence. Our core offering is MicroStrategy 2021™, which delivers modern analytics on an open, comprehensive enterprise platform.

"Item 1. Business Our Company Verint® Systems Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Verint”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”, unless the context indicates otherwise) helps brands provide Boundless Customer Engagement™. For more than two decades, the world’s most iconic brands - including more than 85 of the Fortune 100 companies - have trusted Verint to provide the technology and domain expertise they require to effectively build enduring customer relationships. Brands today are challenged by new workforce dynamics, ever-expanding customer engagement channels and exponentially more consumer interactions - all with limited budgets and resources. As a result, brands are finding it more challenging to deliver the desired customer experience. This creates an Engagement Capacity Gap™, which is widening as digital transformation continues. Organizations are increasingly seeking technology to close this gap, solutions that are based on artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics to automate workflows across enterprise silos to optimize the workforce expense and at the same time to drive an elevated consumer experience. Verint is uniquely positioned to help organizations close the capacity gap with our differentiated Verint Cloud Platform. Verint is headquartered in Melville, New York, and has more than 40 offices worldwide. We have approximately 4,300 passionate professionals around the globe exclusively focused on helping brands provide Boundless Customer Engagement™. Background We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1994 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. On February 1, 2021, we completed the spin-off (the “Spin-Off”) of Cognyte Software Ltd. (“Cognyte”), whose business and operations consisted of our former Cyber Intelligence Solutions business (the “Cognyte Business”), into an independent public company. For additional information regarding Cognyte and the Cognyte Business, see “The Cognyte Spin-Off” below. Through our website at www.verint.com, we make available our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as amendments to those reports, filed or furnished by us pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such materials with, or furnish such materials to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our website address set forth above is not intended to be an active link, and information on our website is not incorporated in, and should not be construed to be a part of, this report. Market Opportunity and Trends We believe there are three main market trends that are benefiting Verint today: the acceleration of digital transformation across the enterprise, the widening of the Engagement Capacity Gap as brands need to elevate customer experiences with fixed resources and budgets, and the ongoing adoption of cloud and AI in our industry. •Digital Transformation is Accelerating. Long gone are the days when customer journeys were limited to phone calls into a contact center. Today, customer journeys take place across many touchpoints in the enterprise and across many communication and collaboration platforms, with digital leading the way. Customer touchpoints take place in contact centers, in back-office and branch operations, in ecommerce, in digital marketing, in self-service, and in customer experience departments. The breadth of customer touchpoints, the rapid growth in digital interactions, and the emergence of the new workforce - with humans and bots working together - are creating demand for new solutions. •The Engagement Capacity Gap is Widening. Brands are seeking to differentiate themselves by providing consumers with a strong brand experience. But they cannot afford to do so by hiring more people. With the exponential growth in digital journeys and more demanding consumer expectations, organizations require more resources, but hiring more knowledge workers and further increasing workforce expenses is often not a sustainable solution. This creates an Engagement Capacity Gap, and as the digital transformation accelerates, the gap is widening. Brands are looking for new technology and solutions to help close the Engagement Capacity Gap. •The Market is Shifting Rapidly to Cloud-Based, AI-Driven Solutions. To effectively address the Engagement Capacity Gap, brands are seeking open, cloud-based solutions to break down silos and facilitate the sharing of data across enterprise functions. Brands also are seeking to leverage AI and other advanced data analytic tools to reduce manual work, increase workforce efficiency, and manage the new workforce of humans and bots. We estimated our total addressable market (“TAM”) to be approximately $65 billion and growing at approximately 10% per year. Approximately $30 billion of this TAM is derived from customer engagement software for contact center use cases, and the other $35 billion is derived from other use cases across other parts of the enterprise outside of the contact center with customer touch points. We estimated our TAM using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, McGee Smith Analytics, Pelorus Associates, Gartner, and Company estimates for the number of customer engagement employees and the amount of software investment that is spent on average per employee per year. Our Strategy We offer our customers and partners an open and modular cloud platform, strong AI and analytics capabilities, and significant customer engagement domain expertise developed over two decades of working closely with thousands of customers across many industries and global operations. Our strategy is to capitalize on the trends described above by: •Helping Brands with Their Digital Transformation. Brands are investing in digital transformation across many areas, including customer engagement. Our strategy is to help them successfully adopt digital technology to evolve and enhance their customer engagement activities and achieve strategic objectives. •Connecting Work, Data, and Experiences to Close the Engagement Capacity Gap. Our open cloud platform enables organizations to connect work, data, and experiences across the enterprise to close the Engagement Capacity Gap. It enables organizations to connect work performed by humans and bots across enterprise functions. It enables organizations to leverage interaction data across silos regardless of channel type or modality. And it enables organizations to capture experiences and derive insights that can improve operational efficiency and elevate customer experience. •Delivering an Open, Modular Cloud Platform and Innovative AI and Analytical Applications.

"ITEM 1. Business Overview Five9 is a pioneer and leading provider of intelligent cloud software for contact centers. We were “born in the cloud,” and since our inception, we have exclusively focused on delivering our platform in the cloud and are disrupting a significantly large market by replacing legacy on-premise contact center systems. Contact centers are vital hubs of interaction between organizations and their customers and, therefore, are essential to delivering successful customer service, sales and marketing strategies. Our mission is to empower organizations to transform their contact centers into customer engagement centers of excellence, while improving business agility and significantly lowering the cost and complexity of their contact center operations. Our purpose-built, highly scalable and secure Virtual Contact Center, or VCC, cloud platform delivers a comprehensive suite of easy-to-use applications that enable the breadth of contact center-related customer service, sales and marketing functions. We have become an established leader in the cloud contact center market, facilitating more than seven billion call minutes between our more than 2,000 clients and their customers per year. We believe our ability to combine software and telephony into a single unified platform that is delivered in the cloud creates a significant advantage. We believe there are two key industry trends driving growth in the cloud contact center market. First is the rapid increase in adoption of cloud contact center software solutions as a result of several distinct factors. The increasing adoption of cloud computing, especially within customer relationship management, or CRM, is creating strong demand for integrated cloud contact center software solutions. In addition, cloud contact center software solutions now offer the functionality required by large, complex enterprise contact centers. Furthermore, we believe organizations typically refresh their on-premise contact center systems every eight to 10 years, which provides an opportunity for cloud solutions to replace legacy on-premise contact center systems when these replacement decisions arise. On-premise systems require large up-front investments, long deployment cycles, and are burdensome to maintain. These systems are also often inflexible, complex, and require significant duplication of effort and integration across multiple sites. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the prevalence of agents working remotely which presents a challenge to premise-based systems that, by design, are focused on a particular physical location. This creates substantial challenges for clients with on-premise contact center systems. As a result, cloud contact center software solutions are continuing to replace legacy on-premise contact center systems. Second is digital transformation. Consumers have the ability to easily and quickly switch brands after experiencing poor customer service. Therefore, it is more critical than ever to provide the tools and technologies to meet consumer demands for a seamless experience across digital channels of their choice. Cloud contact center software solutions provide organizations with the agility to adapt to a rapidly evolving environment and innovative functionalities to reimagine the way they engage with customers. Additionally, with the advent of real-time, accurate and increasingly economical automatic speech recognition and natural language processing, or NLP, previously analog voice conversations with consumers can now be digitized. This newly-digitized data along with text channels such as WhatsApp, SMS, chat and social are increasingly allowing mundane contact center tasks to be handled economically and efficiently by virtual agents and making live agents more efficient. Our solution, comprised of our VCC cloud platform and various associated applications such as Workforce Optimization, or WFO, Workforce Automation, or WFA, and interactive virtual agent, or IVA, allows simultaneous management and optimization of customer interactions across voice, chat, email, web, social media and mobile channels, either directly or through our application programming interfaces, or APIs. Our VCC cloud platform matches each customer interaction with an appropriate agent resource and delivers relevant customer data to the agent in real-time through integrations with adjacent enterprise applications, such as CRM software, to optimize the customer experience and improve agent productivity. Our solution ensures our clients always have the latest version of our software. Delivered on-demand, our solution enables our clients to quickly deploy agent seats in any geographic location with only a computer, headset and broadband internet connection, and rapidly adjust the number of contact center agent seats in response to changing business requirements. Unlike legacy on-premise contact center systems, our solution requires minimal up-front investment, can be rapidly deployed and are maintained by us in the cloud. Our sales model consists of a field sales team that sells our solution into larger opportunities and a telesales team that sells our solution into smaller opportunities. We have developed a proven, high velocity, metrics-driven sales and marketing strategy, designed to effectively identify, qualify and close sales opportunities. To complement this go-to-market strategy, we have developed a large ecosystem of technology and system integrator partners and independent software vendors to help increase awareness of our solution in the market and drive additional sales opportunities with new and existing clients. We have also established, and are continuing to increase, our network of master sales agents, which provide sales leads and resellers that sell our solution to new clients. This network has helped us attract additional clients. Our resellers have assisted us in expanding in both domestic and international markets. We provide our solution through a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, business model with recurring subscriptions based primarily on the number of agent seats and minutes of usage, as well as the specific functionalities and applications our clients deploy. We have achieved significant growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our revenues were $434.9 million, $328.0 million and $257.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 33% and 27%, respectively. We incurred net losses of $42.1 million, $4.6 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of increased investment in our growth, along with higher stock-based compensation and interest expense.

"ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview We are one of the leading Nasdaq publicly traded cryptocurrency mining companies operating in North America. We have made the strategic decision to focus our efforts on mining bitcoin by deploying special cryptocurrency mining computers (known in the industry as “miners”) designed to mine for bitcoin. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we exclusively operated the Antminer series of miners manufactured by Bitmain Technologies Limited (“Bitmain”) to mine bitcoin and, to a much lesser extent, litecoin. We generate substantially all our revenue through our cryptocurrency mining operation. We generate revenue from the cryptocurrency we earn through our mining activities, which we may hold for our own account and or sell at prices and times as determined by our executive management team in accordance with our corporate strategy. The Company is also exploring innovative cryptocurrency mining technologies and other strategic initiatives as part of a continual effort to maximize the energy efficiency and cost effectiveness of its cryptocurrency mining activities. Cryptocurrency Mining We seek to mine bitcoin by using our miners to solve complex cryptographic algorithms to support the Bitcoin blockchain (in a process known as “solving a block”). In return for solving a block, we receive a bitcoin or other cryptocurrency reward, depending on the blockchain, which we hold for our account and attempt to sell on the market to generate a profit. Miners measure their capability in terms of processing power, which is known as in the industry as “hashing” power. Hashing power is measured in terms of the number of hashing algorithms solved (or “hashes”) per second, which is the miner’s “hash rate.” Generally speaking, miners with greater hashing power relative to other miners attempting to solve a block have a higher chance of solving the block and receiving a cryptocurrency award. However, although newer generations of miners advertise improved energy efficiency, we have observed that increasing hash rate generally requires greater electrical power, which increases the cost of solving a block and, therefore, the relative cost of mining a cryptocurrency. As additional miners competed for the limited supply of blocks, individuals found that they were working for months without finding a block and receiving any reward for their mining efforts. To address this variance, miners started organizing into pools to share mining rewards more evenly on a pro rata basis based on total hashing capacity contributed to the mining pool. Participation in Mining Pools A “mining pool” is the pooling of resources by miners, who share their processing power over a network and split rewards according to the amount of hashing power they contributed to the probability of placing a block on the blockchain. Mining pools emerged in response to the growing difficulty and available hashing power that competes to place a block on the bitcoin blockchain. The Company participates in mining pool(s) wherein groups of miners associate to pool their resources together to earn cryptocurrency rewards, which are allocated to each miner according to the “hashing” capacity they contribute to the pool. The mining pool operator provides a service that coordinates the computing power of the independent mining enterprises participating in the mining pool. Fees are paid to the mining pool operator to cover the costs of maintaining the pool. The pool uses software that coordinates the pool members’ hashing power, identifies new block rewards, records how much work all the participants are doing, and assigns block rewards for successful algorithm solutions in-proportion to the individual hash rate that each participant contributed to a given successful mining transaction. While we do not pay pool fees directly, pool fees are deducted from amounts we may otherwise earn. Fees (and payouts) fluctuate and historically have been no more than approximately 2% per reward earned, on average. Mining pools are subject to various risks such as disruption and down time. In the event that a pool experiences down time or is not yielding returns, our results may be impacted. Mining Equipment All of the miners we operate were manufactured by Bitmain, and incorporate application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) chips specialized to solve blocks on the bitcoin blockchains using the 256-bit secure hashing algorithm (“SHA-256”) in return for bitcoin cryptocurrency rewards. Therefore, the only cryptocurrencies we are able to mine using the miners we presently employ or have ordered from Bitmain are those whose blockchain uses SHA-256, including bitcoin. If cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin, cease using SHA-256, we would likely incur significant costs to replace our existing miners. We are continually evaluating the effectiveness of the miners we purchase from Bitmain and we continuously explore new technology developments from Bitmain and other manufacturers, including manufacturers located in Asia, Europe, and domestically in the United States. In late 2019, the Company made a strategic decision to concentrate on increasing its overall hash rate and to update its fleet of miners by acquiring the latest generation Antminer series of miners directly from Bitmain to replace the approximately 7,500 legacy model S9 miners manufactured by Bitmain, which the Company had acquired in third-party transactions in 2017 and 2018. The Company has chosen to focus on acquiring the latest generation of the Antminers directly from Bitmain because the Company’s management believes, both in terms of hash rate produced and energy efficiency, these new Antminers are the most powerful and energy efficient miners available on the market in sufficient quantities to meet our needs; however, advances and improvements to the technology are ongoing and may be available in quantities to the market in the near future which may affect our perceived position. The Company began the process of upgrading its existing mining fleet by ordering ordered 4,000 model S17-Pro Antminers directly from Bitmain in December 2019 for a total purchase price of approximately $6.3 million, which was paid in 2019. All 4,000 of these new Bitmain model S17-Pro Antminers were received and deployed at the Company’s former Oklahoma City, Oklahoma mining facility (the “OKC Facility”) by February 2020. As discussed in greater detail under the section entitled “Mining...","We are a leading publicly traded cryptocurrency mining company in North America.

By de-centralizing BSM workflows and removing unnecessary complexity, our platform reduces an organization’s dependence on its often-backlogged back-office functions, and empowers personnel across the organization to source and purchase goods and services on their own-without sacrificing visibility and control over spending. Our BSM platform delivers a broad range of capabilities that would typically require the purchase and use of multiple disparate point applications. The core of our platform consists of procurement, invoicing, expense management, and payment solutions that form the transactional engine for managing a company’s business spend. In addition, our platform offers specialized modules targeted for power users, to help companies manage more technical and strategic areas of BSM, including areas such as strategic sourcing, contract management, contingent workforce, supplier risk management, supply chain design and planning, treasury management, and spend analysis. We benefit from powerful network effects as our customer and supplier populations continue to grow. As more businesses subscribe to our BSM platform, the collective spend under management on our platform grows. The greater the total amount of spend under management on our platform, the more attractive our platform is to suppliers. As more suppliers join our platform, our buyers benefit from a broader range of purchasing options, which in turn encourages greater use of our platform by existing customers, while also attracting new customers to our platform. In addition, the increasing number of transactions on our platform leads to incrementally powerful prescriptive spend insights and risk management recommendations from our Coupa Community Intelligence solutions, creating more value for customers and providing additional incentives for increased adoption. As we generate more revenue from the increase in customer subscriptions to our services, we are able to make greater investments into our platform, for example, to add new features or improve the functionality and user interface of our solutions, and these enhancements further encourage greater adoption of our platform by businesses, enhancing the network effects that benefit all constituencies. Our customers benefit from our rapidly growing network in a multitude of ways. We describe the ecosystem of business buyers, suppliers and partners that use our services as a “community.” Like any community, each member can contribute value to the community, and can also benefit, directly or indirectly, from the participation of other members of the community. For example, through programs that leverage group buying power; through recommendations based on insights extracted from anonymized data on transactions occurring within the platform; and through access to community message boards and channels for direct communication between community participants. Our Community Intelligence capabilities apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to spend transactions across the growing Coupa community to identify trends and prescribe best practices that help customers optimize spend, reduce risk, and improve efficiency. Additionally, we provide purchasing programs, such as Coupa Advantage, which offers access to pre-negotiated discounts from various suppliers, and Source Together, which connects community members to engage in group sourcing events, allowing them to leverage pooled buying power to achieve better contracting terms and capture greater savings. Moreover, through our Coupa Open Business Network, suppliers of all sizes can list their goods and services, establish pricing, and interact with buyers electronically, thus significantly reducing paper, improving operating efficiencies, and reducing costs. We believe a critical, differentiating feature of Coupa’s approach to BSM is our company culture. That culture is built on three guiding principles we refer to as our core values: (1) ensuring customer success, (2) focusing on results; and (3) striving for excellence. We emphasize these principles continuously through formal training and informal messaging within the organization, and the results of our annual employee surveys consistently demonstrate that our employees have adopted and strive to embody them. These principles inform how we treat each other within our organization, and how we approach interactions with our customers, suppliers, partners, and others with whom we do business. Our unwavering focus on customer success means that we expect to deliver quantifiable business value to our customers by helping them maximize their spend under management. We believe this mindset serves as the foundation for the successful execution of our strategy, and, as a result, is critical to our growth. We focus on results. Our market leading technology supports rapid time-to-deployment, typically ranging from a few weeks to several months, achieving swift time to value. We strive for excellence in many ways, one example of which is through our product release and update cycles. Here, we seek to improve product design iteratively, based on user feedback, as we look to build ever-more intuitive, easy-to-use interfaces to shield users from the complexity associated with more traditional, legacy enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") and procurement solutions. Our relentless commitment to the embodiment of our core values supports the creation of meaningful, measurable customer value within a short timeframe, resulting in a rapid return on investment for our customers.

"ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview DocuSign helps organizations do business faster with less risk, lower costs, and better experiences for customers and employees. We accomplish this by transforming the foundational element of business: the agreement. Agreements are everywhere. In the regular course of doing business, organizations sign contracts, offer letters, and hundreds of other types of agreements with customers, employees, and business partners. This is true for every size of organization, in every industry, across every business function, worldwide. Every agreement has an agreement process: how it is prepared, signed, acted on, and managed. Traditional agreement processes are slow, expensive and error-prone because they involve many manual steps, disconnected systems, and paper signing. Our value proposition is simple to understand: eliminate the paper, automate the processes, and connect to other systems where work gets done. This allows organizations to substantially reduce turnaround times and costs, as well as largely eliminate errors. The DocuSign Agreement Cloud is our cloud software suite for automating and connecting the entire agreement process. It includes DocuSign eSignature, the world’s #1 electronic signature solution. DocuSign eSignature allows an agreement to be signed electronically on a wide variety of devices, from virtually anywhere in the world, securely. The Agreement Cloud also includes several other applications for automating pre- and post-signature processes-for example, automatically generating an agreement from data in other systems, supporting negotiation workflow, collecting payment after signatures, and using artificial intelligence (“A”I) to analyze a collection of agreements for risks and opportunities. Finally, the Agreement Cloud includes hundreds of integrations to other systems, so agreement processes can integrate with larger business processes and data. The DocuSign Agreement Cloud has more than 890,000 customers and hundreds of millions of users. Our customers range from the largest global enterprises to sole proprietorships, across industries, around the world. Within a given organization, our technology can be used broadly across business functions: contracts for sales, employment offers for human resources, non-disclosure agreements for legal, among many others. For example, one of our customers has implemented more than 300 such use cases across its enterprise. This broad potential applicability drives our total addressable market for electronic signature to be approximately $25 billion according to our estimates, with substantial upside for automating aspects of the agreement process before and after the signature. To address our opportunity, our sales and marketing strategy focuses on enterprise businesses, commercial businesses, and very small businesses (“VSBs”). We rely on our direct sales force and partnerships to sell to enterprises and commercial businesses, and our web-based self-service channel to sell to VSBs, which is the most cost-effective way to reach our smallest customers. We offer subscriptions to our products, which include editions with varying functionality for different customers’ needs-as well as products and features specific to particular geographies or industries. We also focus on customer adoption, success and expansion. This helps us deliver continued value and creates opportunities for increased usage. In addition, our marketing and sales efforts often benefit from the fact that many of our prospects already know us from being signers-for example, they might have accepted a job offer or completed the purchase of a home via DocuSign eSignature. These experiences tend to have a meaningful impact on people’s lives. As a result, when we sell into these people’s companies, we often find that awareness and favorability toward DocuSign is already present among buyers and influencers. The DocuSign Agreement Cloud Since inception in 2003, DocuSign pioneered the electronic signature category and now offers the world’s #1 electronic signature solution. In our evolution, it became apparent that digitizing and automating signatures was the trigger to a larger transformation of the agreement process itself-from preparing to signing, acting on, and managing agreements. The opportunity to address this larger transformation gave rise to the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, our cloud software suite for automating the entire agreement process. The Agreement Cloud is an umbrella for: DocuSign, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K | 5 •A suite of applications that span the entire agreement process. These applications and add-ons are detailed below under “Our Products.” •Hundreds of integrations with other systems where work gets done, such as applications offered by Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, and Workday. For example, because of an integration that embeds DocuSign functionality into the Salesforce user experience, a sales representative can generate, send, and track an agreement via DocuSign services without ever leaving the Salesforce application. Behind the scenes, account data from Salesforce can automatically pre-fill the agreement. After signature, DocuSign services can pass any other data collected or generated in the agreement process back to Salesforce. •Platform technologies such as APIs (application programming interfaces) and common infrastructure, detailed below in “Our Technology, Infrastructure and Operations.” In addition to what we do, we believe we are distinguished by how we do it: •Stringent security standards. We seek to meet the industry’s most rigorous security certification standards and use the strongest data encryption technologies that are commercially available. We believe our systems and processes also exceed industry practices for data protection, transmission and secure storage-including being certified for the global security gold standard, ISO 27001, among many other privacy and security certifications. •Highly available. Our main infrastructure is powered by near real-time data synchronization across a ring of three geo-dispersed data centers in the United States (“U.S.”), and a similar ring of data centers in Europe. This infrastructure has enabled us to deliver over 99.99% availability to our eSignature customers and users worldwide over the past 12 months. •Globally adopted. Our expertise in electronic signature and other agreement technologies is truly global. This is key, given that different regions have different laws, standards and cultural norms. We enable multiple parties in different jurisdictions to complete agreements and other documents in a legally valid manner. In Europe, we have offerings tailored for the European Union's (“EU’s”) eIDAS regulations, as well as for verifying European eIDs. To follow longstanding tradition in Japan, we enable signers to upload and apply their personal eHanko to represent their signatures on an agreement. •Highly...","DocuSign helps organizations transform the agreement.

"Item 1. Business Bentley Systems: The Infrastructure Engineering Software Company We are a leading global provider of software for infrastructure engineering, enabling the work of civil, structural, geotechnical, and plant engineering practitioners, their project delivery enterprises, and owner-operators of infrastructure assets. We were founded in 1984 by the Bentley brothers. Our enduring commitment is to develop and support the most comprehensive portfolio of integrated software offerings across professional disciplines, project and asset lifecycles, infrastructure sectors, and geographies. Our software enables digital workflows across engineering disciplines, distributed project teams, from offices to the field, and across computing form factors, including desktops, on-premises servers, cloud-native services, mobile devices, and web browsers. We deliver our solutions via on-premise, cloud, and hybrid environments. Our users engineer, construct, and operate projects and assets across the following infrastructure sectors: •public works (including roads, rail, airports, ports, and water and wastewater networks)/utilities (including electric, gas, water, and communications). We estimate that this sector represents 51% of the net infrastructure asset value of the global top 500 infrastructure owners (the “global top 500 infrastructure owners”) based on the 2020 edition of the Bentley Infrastructure 500 Top Owners, our annual compilation of the world’s largest infrastructure owners ranked by net depreciated value of their tangible fixed assets; •industrial (including discrete and process manufacturing, power generation, and water treatment plants)/resources (including oil and gas, mining, and offshore). We estimate that this sector represents 37% of the global top 500 infrastructure owners’ net infrastructure asset value; and •commercial/facilities (including office buildings, hospitals, and campuses). We estimate that this sector represents 12% of the global top 500 infrastructure owners’ net infrastructure asset value. We address both the project and asset lifecycle phases of infrastructure, each with applications and enterprise information systems. Our Project Lifecycle solutions encompass conception, planning, surveying, design, engineering, simulation, and construction, as well as the collaboration offerings required to coordinate and share the work of interdisciplinary and/or distributed project teams. Our Asset Lifecycle solutions span the operating life of commissioned infrastructure assets, allowing our accounts to manage engineering changes for safety and compliance and to model performance and reliability to support operating and maintenance decisions. Our Solutions We offer solutions for enterprises and professionals across the infrastructure lifecycle. Our Project Delivery and Asset and Network Performance solutions are systems provided via cloud and hybrid environments, developed respectively to extend enterprise collaboration during project delivery, and to manage and leverage engineering information during operations and maintenance. Our Design Integration and Digital Cities solutions are primarily desktop applications and cloud-provisioned solutions for professional practitioners and workgroups. Our cloud-native Digital Twins solutions introduce digital workflows, which can span our Project Lifecycle and Asset Lifecycle solutions. Project Lifecycle Solutions. Our Project Lifecycle solutions span conception, planning, surveying, design, simulation, and construction, as well as the collaboration software services required to coordinate and share the work of interdisciplinary and/or distributed project teams. Design Integration. Our Design Integration solutions consist of modeling and simulation applications. Our modeling applications are domain-specific authoring tools used by professionals for the 3D design and documentation of infrastructure assets. Our simulation applications enable engineers to analyze the functional performance of the designs created with our modeling applications (or those of competitive vendors), preferably in iterative digital workflows, to improve engineering outcomes and to ensure compliance with design codes. Benefits of our Design Integration applications to infrastructure engineers include: •Better designs. Our modeling and simulation applications work together to improve infrastructure engineering quality, for instance to eliminate “clashes” across respective disciplines’ work. Each application is for a specific purpose (asset-type or discipline; for example, OpenRoads for roadway design), and supports corresponding asset-specific engineering workflows (for example, the workflow a civil engineer would use in designing a road) by virtue of: •Better engineering productivity. We endeavor to provide in our applications the most advanced and automated intelligence for transforming engineers’ conceptual decisions into complete, detailed, and editable deliverables; and •Better configurability and continuity. We take care to enable users to continuously refine their modeling preferences and standards across successive generations of our applications. This capability enables engineers, throughout their careers, to maintain continuity and compatibility with their preferred interfaces, formats, and methodologies, while advancing their work at the leading edge of innovation; •Better deliverables. Our applications share a common modeling environment to enable streamlined coordination and production of multi-discipline documentation; and •Better handoff. Our comprehensive modeling environment and our supplemental cloud services enable projects to enrich information sharing (and to minimize problematic translations) across project delivery processes. For instance: •by starting with reality modeling of existing conditions (often from drone surveying); •by sharing engineering component definitions across disciplines and projects; and •through “constructioneering” digital workflows, which automate the exchange of 3D design models to control GPS-enabled construction equipment (for earthmoving and paving), and to validate and preserve the resulting 3D as-built models for maintenance. Project Delivery. Our Project Delivery solutions support information and document management, engineering-specific collaboration and work-sharing for distributed project teams and enterprises, and construction planning, modeling and execution. The scope of these solutions is not limited to users of only our own design applications. Often during the project delivery lifecycle, key data are constantly changing, with inputs received from multiple sources, resulting in the need for a single source of information that is used to collect, manage, and disseminate information for the whole project team. Our software assures that the rapidly-changing data are managed in a common data environment (“CDE”) such that only the correct milestone versions can be shared and referenced across the project. This functionality enables infrastructure project organizations to “virtualize” their talent so that the required work can be shared by all participants everywhere through our software, reducing the need for physical co-location of the project resources. Our 4D construction modeling software spatially and temporally integrates a project’s 3D engineering models into its construction schedules to assess sequencing strategies and to visualize and understand planned and actual progress over the project timeline. Our solutions also enable project delivery teams to optimally define and manage discrete engineering,...","Bentley Systems is a global provider of software for infrastructure engineering, enabling the work of civil, structural, geotechnical, and plant engineering practitioners, their project delivery enterprises, and owner-operators of infrastructure assets.

For additional details, see Note 1, Nature of Business and Note 3, Divestitures and Business Combinations of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. The Challenges We Address We believe that many companies face a common set of challenges that divert limited time and resources away from serving their customers and growing their businesses. Significant administrative burdens from inefficient manual processes and the use of disparate technologies or loosely integrated solutions only exacerbate those challenges. This is particularly evident in businesses that involve unique workflows, relationships among multiple users, significant data inputs and management, and compliance or regulatory requirements. Our platform is designed to provide our customers an intuitive, reliable and integrated solution that brings innovative technology and services to their specific workflows, meets their key operational requirements and enables delivery of exceptional customer experiences. We rely on partners and third party service providers to deliver certain aspects of our solutions, and we strive to provide a seamlessly integrated experience for our customers. We believe our customer-centric culture fosters a focus on customer satisfaction which leads to long-term customer retention and our long-term success. We believe our solutions and services offer customers the ability to capitalize on the power of fully integrated business management software to interact with their business ecosystems, and to mine the data and insights gleaned from these relationships, which is integral to our customers' ability to grow their businesses and compete effectively. Growth Strategy Our growth strategy is to provide increasingly valuable industry-specific business management software, services and data analytics to new and existing customers and their business ecosystems. We believe our customer-centric culture and market validation techniques that direct our product strategy are key to our success. Key components of our growth strategy include: Maintain Product and Technology Leadership. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in research and new product development to expand our platform capabilities as we deem appropriate in our target markets. We intend to continue using our market validation techniques and close relationships with our customers and users as a key source of feedback to inform and direct our product strategy. We may also choose to acquire rather than build certain technology capabilities, or to partner with third parties to deliver key functionality to serve the needs of our customers and their business ecosystems. Keep Our Existing Customers and Users Happy. We believe customer success is essential to our long-term success. We place significant emphasis on customer service, which we believe leads to long-term customer relationships, to differentiate our software, services and data analytics from competing products. This emphasis will continue to be a critical component of our growth strategy in the future. We believe that maintaining our focus on customer success will lead to new product innovation, the referral of new customers from existing satisfied customers, and greater adoption and utilization of our solutions and services.

The SharpSpring platform is designed to improve the way that businesses communicate with their prospects and customers to increase sales. The Company’s flagship Marketing Automation platform uses advanced features such as web tracking, lead scoring and automated workflow to help businesses deliver the right message to the right customer at the right time. The SharpSpring platform is designed and built as a Software as Service (or SaaS) offering. We provide our products on a subscription basis, with additional fees charged if specified volume limits are exceeded by our customers. The Company’s Perfect Audience platform expands our product and service offering into advertisement retargeting for small businesses. The Perfect Audience platform employs a usage-based revenue model. Revenue from this platform is dependent on the number of ads placed through the platform and the effectiveness of that ad space. We operate globally through SharpSpring, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and our wholly owned subsidiaries that consist of (i) SharpSpring Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation; (ii) SharpSpring Reach, Inc., a Delaware corporation; (iii) InterInbox SA, a Swiss corporation; (iv) ERNEPH 2012A (Pty) Ltd., a South African limited company; (v) ERNEPH 2012B (Pty) Ltd., a South African limited company; and (vi) SMTP Holdings S.a.r.l., a Luxembourg S.a.r.l. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” and other similar terms means SharpSpring, Inc., and its subsidiaries. Products and Services SharpSpring We provide SaaS-based marketing technologies to customers around the world. Our focus is on marketing automation tools that enable customers to interact with a lead from an early stage and nurture that potential customer using advanced features until it becomes a qualified sales lead or customer. Our platform also includes customer relationship management (CRM) technology that enables a business to store, manage, and optimize customer and prospect data in a cloud-based environment. SharpSpring Mail+ Our SharpSpring Mail+ product is a subset of the full suite solution that is focused on more traditional email marketing while also including some of the advanced functionality available in our premium offering. A small portion of our customers utilize our SharpSpring Mail+ product. Perfect Audience Our Perfect Audience platform is a product and service offering to small businesses for display retargeting. Perfect Audience is designed for rapid deployment and offers customers an easy-to-use interface to implement and optimize campaigns across all major networks and devices. Markets & Competition Our SharpSpring products compete primarily in the marketing automation, revenue growth, and advertisement retargeting markets. The market for marketing automation software and related solutions is evolving and highly competitive with expected competition to increase as barriers decrease as does complexity of the technology decreases. SharpSpring entered the market in 2014 with a highly competitive offering that achieved meaningful customer adoption in its first few years after launch. As of December 31, 2020, the SharpSpring platforms collectively had over 3,500 paying customers and over 10,000 businesses using the platform, including agencies, agency clients, and direct end-user customers. SharpSpring We face competition from cloud-based software and SaaS companies, including HubSpot, Act-On, Pardot (part of Salesforce.com), and ActiveCampaign for our flagship Marketing Automation platform. We differentiate ourselves from the competition with the integration of specific tools designed for digital marketing agencies, and with SharpSpring’s advanced features, ease of use, platform flexibility, and value compared to other competitive offerings. SharpSpring is designed as a solution for small or mid-sized businesses but focuses on selling to marketing agencies, who serve as partners providing a distribution channel to their clients. The majority of SharpSpring customers are digital marketing agencies. A digital marketing agency is a firm that specializes in helping clients, usually small or mid-sized businesses, with their digital marketing initiatives like websites, email marketing, search engine optimization, social campaigns, pay-per-click advertising and other digital lead generation activities. We have built special tools in the SharpSpring application to allow agencies to manage their clients on the platform and optimize their efforts across their portfolio. We also have special pricing to agency customers to allow them the flexibility to resell the platform at a profit and manage their client relationships. In general, when we sell SharpSpring to an agency customer, we provide the agency with a SharpSpring license for the agency to use, plus a 3-pack of client licenses for the agency to deploy to their client base. This agency license and the pack of licenses are generally sold for a monthly recurring fee, plus an up-front onboarding fee. The agency has complete discretion over the pricing of the platform to their clients for the use, implementation, and services related to SharpSpring. If an agency utilizes its pack of licenses and adds additional clients on to the platform, there is a monthly per-client fee charged to the agency based on the number of additional licenses the agency has deployed to their clients. Additionally, we charge customers for certain items if the volume or transactional limits are exceeded, such as emails sent, or contacts stored in the platform. In most cases, we provide support to the agency and the agency provides support to their clients on the platform. However, for additional fees, we can provide product support to the agency’s client directly. Our objective is to partner with the agencies to grow and expand our businesses together using the SharpSpring platform. Approximately one-fifth of our Marketing Automation customers are individual businesses that have licensed SharpSpring directly without working through an agency. We refer to these customers as “Direct Customers.” Similar to agency customers, Direct Customers pay a monthly subscription fee for the use of the platform, plus an up-front onboarding fee. Additionally, we charge Direct Customers additional transactional charges based on usage over certain limits.

"Item 1. Business General iSign Solutions Inc. (the “Company” or “iSign”), was incorporated in Delaware in October 1986. iSign is a leading supplier of digital transaction management (DTM) software enabling the paperless, secure and cost-effective management and authentication of document-based transactions. iSign’s solutions encompass a wide array of functionality and services, including electronic signatures, simple-to-complex workflow management and various options for biometric authentication. These solutions are available across virtually all enterprise, desktop and mobile environments as a seamlessly integrated platform for both ad-hoc and fully automated transactions. iSign’s platform can be deployed both on premise and as a cloud-based (“SaaS”) service, with the ability to easily transition between deployment models. The Company is headquartered in San Jose, California. In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, several states in the U.S., including California, where the Company is headquartered, have experienced an increase of new cases of COVID-19. It is uncertain if this trend will continue into 2021, as shown by the recent uptick in reported cases. The COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a wide range of industries. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. For the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenue was $966, an increase of $122, or 14%, compared to total revenue of $844 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, software product revenue was $247, an increase of $52, or 27%, compared to product revenue of $195 in the prior year. Maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $719, an increase of $70, or 11%, compared to maintenance revenue of $649 in the prior year. These increases are primarily attributable to the Company’s growth in recurring revenue and related engineering services. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net loss was $528, a decrease of $558, or 51%, compared to $1,086 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, non-cash charges, consisting of interest expense, warrant expense and the amortization of debt discount were $293, a decrease of $11, or 4%, compared to $304 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, operating expenses were $1,619, a decrease of $8, or 0.5%, compared to operating expenses of $1,627 for the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses resulted from reductions in the amortization of stock options and warrant compensation and professional service expenses. Core Technologies The Company’s core technologies can be referred to as “transaction-enabling” and “business process work flow” technologies. These technologies include various forms of electronic signature methods, such as handwritten, biometric, click-to-sign and others, as well as technologies related to signature verification, authentication, cryptography and the logging of audit trails to prove signers’ intent. These technologies enable the appending of secure, legal and regulatory compliant electronic signatures coupled with an enhanced user experience, all at a fraction of the time and cost required by traditional, paper-based processes for signature capture. Products The Company’s enterprise-class SignatureOne® and iSign® suite of electronic signature solutions enable businesses to implement truly paperless, electronic signature-driven business processes. The aggregate of the software functionality enabling the digitization of end-to-end work flow processes is sometimes referred to as “digital transaction management” (DTM). Many applications provide electronic forms and allow users to fill-in information, but most of these applications still require users to print out a paper copy for a handwritten, ink signature. Solutions powered by iSign products allow legally binding electronic signatures to be added to digital documents, eliminating the need for paper to memorialize the completion, approval or authentication of the transaction. This allows users to reduce transaction times and processing costs. The SignatureOne® and iSign® suite of products includes the following: SignatureOne® Ceremony® Server The SignatureOne® Ceremony® Server (“Ceremony Server”) provides a highly secure, scalable, patent-protected and streamlined electronic signature solution. Its flexible, easy-to-configure and agile workflow can be rapidly integrated via standard Web services to become an ultimate and cost efficient endpoint in true straight-through processing (the complete removal of paper from business processes) and to facilitate end-to-end management of multi-party approvals for PDF and XHTML documents. The Ceremony Server contains iSign’s core e-signature engine and signature ceremony management tools, and can be seamlessly integrated with numerous ancillary products. Its key features include: ● Consent/disclosure management - integral part of audit record; easily reproducible in the event of a dispute; ● Configurable document presentment - signatory receipt, access and viewing of document tracked in audit trail; ● Multi-party ceremonies - complex processes, simplified; allows for dynamic, multi-channel workflow changes, including remote, face-to-face and mobile scenarios; ● Supports complex business rules and dynamic user behaviors; ● Configurable branding and workflow; ● Flexible tracking and reporting - includes event notification service ● Extensive audit trail - embedded in individual document in a tamper evident digital seal; and ● Support for multiple signature methods - click-to-sign; biometric; and others. iSign® Console™ The iSign® Console™ (“Console”) leverages the Ceremony Server’s core signature engine and is ideal for organizations looking for a standalone electronic signature solution. Through its intuitive graphical interface, the Console allows users to upload documents for signature, select signers and signature methods, and manage and enforce document workflow for routing, reviewing, signing and notifications.

We intend to continue using an outsourced and leveraged model to maintain efficiency and manage costs as we grow our licensing business by, for example, offering incentives to early licensing targets or asserting our rights for use of our patents. Index Industry Overview & Trends We believe that the rapid growth in remote work has accelerated digital business transformation initiatives that would have taken years, into a matter of months. The demand to work remotely, explosive growth of video conferencing tools and rapid growth in the cloud has created an opportunity to secure communications regardless of a user’s location, network, or BYOD (bring your own device). The shift to remote work and expansion of the enterprise network perimeter has driven the growth of ZTNA solutions. The Zero Trust concept treats all networks like the Internet, where all users and devices are untrusted by default. Their location within the network is not a factor for deciding trust. Each user and device on the network require authentication and authorization, based on policy, prior to accessing any applications or resources on the network. ZTNA facilitates security around remote work, because Zero Trust policies enable granular access control, end-to-end encryption of network communications and remove application visibility from the public Internet reducing the attack surface. Based on our research and estimates, we believe that the Zero-Trust Security Market size is projected to grow from USD 15.6 billion in 2019 to USD 38.6 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 19.9% from 2019 to 2024. We believe Zero Trust represents a growing market and an ideal fit for our technology and products.

"Item 1. Business GENERAL Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE: FICO) (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” which may also be referred to in this report as “we,” “us,” “our,” and “FICO”) is a leading applied analytics company. We were founded in 1956 on the premise that data, used intelligently, can improve business decisions. Today, FICO’s software and the widely used FICO® Score operationalize analytics, enabling thousands of businesses in nearly 120 countries to uncover new opportunities, make timely decisions that matter, and execute them at scale. Most leading banks and credit card issuers rely on our solutions, as do insurers, retailers, telecommunications providers, automotive companies, public agencies, and organizations in other industries. We also serve consumers through online services that enable people to access and understand their FICO Scores, the standard measure in the U.S. of consumer credit risk, empowering them to increase financial literacy and manage their financial health. More information about us can be found on our website, www.fico.com. We make our Annual Reports on Forms 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q, and Current Reports on Forms 8-K, as well as amendments to those reports, available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). References to our website address in this report do not constitute an incorporation by reference. Information on our website is not part of this report. PRODUCTS AND SERVICES Our business consists of two operating segments: Scores and Software. Our Scores segment includes our business-to-business (“B2B”) scoring solutions and services which give our clients access to predictive credit and other scores that can be easily integrated into their transaction streams and decision-making processes. This segment also includes our business-to-consumer (“B2C”) scoring solutions, including our myFICO.com subscription offerings. Our Software segment includes pre-configured analytic and decision management solutions designed for a specific type of business need or process - such as account origination, customer management, customer engagement, fraud detection, financial crimes compliance, and marketing - as well as associated professional services. This segment also includes FICO® Platform, a modular software offering designed to support advanced analytic and decision use cases, as well as stand-alone analytic and decisioning software that can be configured by our customers to address a wide variety of business use cases. Our offerings are available to our customers as software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) or as on-premises software. Scores Our B2B scoring solutions include the FICO® Score, which is the standard measure of consumer credit risk in the U.S. It is used in most U.S. credit decisions, by nearly all major banks, credit card issuers, mortgage lenders, and auto loan originators. Our B2B scoring solutions are primarily distributed through major consumer reporting agencies worldwide. Our B2C scores are sold directly to consumers through our myFICO.com website and other direct-to-consumer channels. The FICO® Score is a three-digit number ranging from 300-850. Our proprietary analytic algorithms are applied to credit data collected and maintained by the three U.S. national consumer reporting agencies - Experian, TransUnion and Equifax - to produce standard scores that are used across the credit lifecycle, including in origination, account management and consumer marketing. Users of our scores generally pay the consumer reporting agencies a fee for each individual score generated by our algorithms, and the consumer reporting agencies pay an associated fee to us. Except for product development using de-personalized data, FICO does not collect or store the consumer credit data used in the calculation of our scores, and in most cases, we do not sell our scores directly to lenders or other end-users. Since the introduction of the FICO® Score in the U.S. in 1989, we have regularly updated the score to take advantage of newly available data and enhanced analytics. Our most recent and most predictive scores, FICO® Score 10 and 10T, were introduced in January 2020. To increase its predictive power, FICO Score 10T builds on FICO Score 10 but also incorporates trended credit data. Trended data considers a longer historical view, giving lenders even more insight into how individuals are managing their credit. When we introduced FICO® Score 9 in 2015, it also made use of newly available data such as reported rental payment history, while also de-emphasizing medical debt and disregarding paid collections. Most of our scores distributed today are FICO® Score 8 and FICO® Score 9. While our newer scores generally provide greater predictive accuracy than the scores they replace, we ensure that new versions of the standard FICO® Score are compatible with prior versions of the FICO Score. In addition to the FICO® Score, we offer several other broad-based scores, including specific FICO® Industry Scores. For example, in July 2021 we introduced Bankcard and Auto Industry versions of FICO® Score 10. We also develop various custom scores for our financial services clients. The FICO® Resilience Index is a recently introduced offering designed to complement FICO® Score models by identifying those consumers who are more resilient to economic stress relative to other consumers within the same FICO Score bands. The FICO Resilience Index is designed to enable lenders to continue to lend and better manage risk by providing a more precise assessment of loan default risk during periods of economic stress. FICO has invested significant resources in the development of scores that can help expand credit access and lower borrowing costs for consumers that have limited credit history or who have sparse or inactive credit files. These scores use alternative data sources to enhance conventional credit bureau data and generate scores for otherwise un-scorable consumers and in many cases improve the credit scores of scorable consumers. •FICO® Score XD uses public records and property data, and a consumer’s history with mobile phone, landline phone and cable payments, to generate scores on the same 300-850 scale as standard FICO® Scores. FICO Score XD is available to lenders through our distribution partners, LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Equifax. •The UltraFICOTM Score uses consumer-permissioned data such as checking, savings, or money market account data, to generate...","We were founded in 1956 on the premise that data, used intelligently, can improve business decisions.

Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business We are actively monitoring, evaluating, and responding to developments relating to COVID-19, which has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in significant global, social, and business disruption. While we instituted a global work-from-home policy beginning in March 2020, which has been modified to provide employees with the choice to work in certain of our offices when and as they feel comfortable, we did not incur significant disruptions in our work operations during fiscal 2021. We are conducting business as usual with restrictions to employee travel, and we have transitioned in-person marketing events to virtual formats, among other modifications. We expect these changes will substantially remain in effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and could extend to future quarters. We will continue to actively monitor the situation, including progress made through vaccinations, and we will make further changes to our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities and that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders. Our focus remains on the safety of our employees, and we strive to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, in part, by providing technology to our employees, end-customers, and partners to help them do their best work while remote.

"Item 1. Business Overview We have created comprehensive cloud-based solutions designed to transform and modernize accounting and finance operations for organizations of all types and sizes. Our secure, scalable solutions support critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, cash application, intercompany accounting, and compliance. By introducing software to automate these processes and to enable them to function continuously, we empower our customers to improve the integrity of their financial reporting, increase efficiency in their accounting and finance processes and enhance real-time visibility into their results and operations. Critical accounting and finance processes underlie the integrity of an organization’s financial reports. The lack of effective accounting and finance tools can result in inefficient and cumbersome processes and, in some cases, accounting errors, restatements and write-offs, as well as material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. Traditional enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems do not generally provide effective solutions for processes handled outside of an organization’s general ledger, such as balance sheet account reconciliation, intercompany transaction accounting and the broader financial close process. Many organizations also use multiple ERPs and other financial systems without a platform to efficiently integrate them. As a result, to manage these tasks, organizations rely on spreadsheets and other error-prone and labor-intensive processes that are unsuited for the increasing regulatory complexity and transaction volumes encountered by many modern businesses. We believe that we are creating a new category of powerful cloud-based software that is capable of automating and streamlining accounting and finance operations, in a manner that complements and supports traditional ERP systems. We believe our customers benefit from cost savings through improvements in process management and staff productivity, in addition to managing a faster financial close. Our mission is to transform how accounting and finance departments operate. Our approach modernizes what historically has been done through batch processing and manual controls typically applied only during the month, quarter or year-end financial close, and delivers dynamic workflows embedded within a real-time, highly automated framework, a process we refer to as “continuous accounting.” It also enables up-to-date analytics, provides industry-benchmarked metrics and is designed to help customers run more efficiently while achieving greater accuracy, control and transparency. We believe the need for our software has been driven by growing business and information technology complexities, transaction volumes and expanding regulatory requirements. Our software integrates with, and obtains data from, more than 30 different ERP systems, including NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, and Workday, as well as many other financial systems and applications such as bank accounts, sub-ledgers and in-house databases. We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems, Inc. (“BlackLine Systems”). BlackLine Systems funded its business with investments from our founder and cash flows from operations until September 3, 2013. On September 3, 2013, we acquired BlackLine Systems, and Silver Lake Sumeru and Iconiq acquired a controlling interest in us, which we refer to as the “2013 Acquisition.” The 2013 Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and resulted in a change in accounting basis as of the date of the 2013 Acquisition. On October 2, 2020, we acquired Rimilia Holdings Ltd. (“Rimilia”), which is referred to as the “Rimilia Acquisition"". The primary purpose of the Rimilia Acquisition was to extend the Company’s capabilities into an adjacent area, adding accounts receivable automation to financial close automation. Our cloud-based products include Account Reconciliations, Cash Application, Compliance, Consolidation Integrity Manager, Intercompany Hub, Journal Entry, Task Management, Transaction Matching, and Variance Analysis. These products are offered to customers as scalable solutions that support critical accounting processes, such as the financial close, account reconciliations, cash application, intercompany accounting, and compliance. Our Growth Strategy Our principal growth strategies include the following: Continue to Innovate and Expand our Platform. Our ability to internally develop or make strategic acquisitions of new, market-leading applications and functionalities is integral to our success, and we intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our applications to bring new solutions to accounting and finance. Enhance Our Leadership Position with Enterprise Market and Mid-Market Companies. We believe we have a leading position in the enhanced financial controls and automation market with both enterprise market and mid-market companies. We intend to leverage our brand, history of innovation, and customer focus to maintain and grow our leadership position with enterprise market businesses. In addition, we believe that mid-market businesses are particularly underserved and that our platform can help these businesses modernize their accounting and finance processes efficiently and effectively. Increase Existing Customer Spend through Expanded Usage and Adoption of Additional Products. We pursue a land-and-expand sales model and believe there is significant opportunity to increase sales of our solutions within our existing customer base. Our pricing model is designed to allow us to capture additional revenue as our customers’ usage of our platform grows, providing us with an opportunity to increase the lifetime value of our customer relationships. Expand Our International Operations and Customer Footprint. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand the use of our cloud-based products outside the United States.

"Item 1. Business Overview Yext, Inc. (""Yext"" or the ""Company"") organizes a business's facts so it can provide official answers to consumer questions starting with the business's own website and then extending across search engines and voice assistants. Our platform lets businesses structure the facts about their brands in a database called the Knowledge Graph. Our platform is built to leverage the structured data stored in the Knowledge Graph to deliver a modern search experience on a business’s or organization's own website, as well as across approximately 200 service and application providers, which we refer to as our Knowledge Network, and includes Amazon Alexa, Apple Maps, Bing, Cortana, Facebook, Google, Google Assistant, Google Maps, Siri and Yelp. Our platform powers all of our key features, including Listings, Pages, and Answers, along with its other features and capabilities. We believe a business is the ultimate authority on its own facts, and it is our mission to put that business in control of it, everywhere. The online consumer journey is changing. With the introduction of natural language processing and the growing prevalence of voice assistants and chatbots, search has become more conversational. Consumers are no longer just typing in individual keywords like “mortgage” or “menswear,” but are also using natural language phrases like “wealth advisor near me who specializes in healthcare” and even asking specific, complex questions like “what’s the best menswear store in London that sells dress shirts and is open now?” Web and mobile applications and voice and artificial intelligence, or AI, engines are increasingly answering questions directly and in certain cases providing only one answer unlike traditional web-based search where many results are displayed as a list requiring further exploration. As search continues to evolve, and increasingly leverages AI, consumers are more likely to rely on these direct answers. While consumer online search behavior has changed, the site search experience on many businesses’ websites has not evolved to meet consumer expectations. Numerous site searches are unable to understand natural language queries instead returning a list of links based on keywords rather than direct answers. Poor user experience on a business’s own website may result in lost sales opportunities or may cause consumers to visit a competitor’s website. The challenge for businesses is to understand and provide accurate answers to consumer’s questions while delivering a rich, consistent search experience on their website as well as third-party applications. Many answers and results provided by searches currently come from third-party sources such as data aggregators, governmental agencies and consumers. The net result of this third-party sourcing has been to produce “best guess” data that can often be incomplete, misleading or incorrect. Yext pioneered a better way for businesses to control and publish the critical facts about themselves to answer consumer questions. We have built our business on the fundamental premise that the best source of accurate and timely information about a business is the business itself. We do this first by empowering brands to structure the public facts about themselves in a database called the Knowledge Graph. The Knowledge Graph organizes data in a way that can answer complex questions by storing both data points themselves and the multiple relationships between data points. Our products and features are built to leverage the structured data stored in the Knowledge Graph so businesses can provide official answers to consumer questions. Businesses of nearly all sizes and in a diverse set of industries can benefit from our platform and capabilities. Yext enables businesses to: •provide direct answers to consumer questions about their business on their own website; •modify, enhance and control the facts about each of their locations, professionals, menus, events or other entities managed with our platform; •update once and disseminate changes to their listings across the most widely used third-party maps, apps, search engines, GPS systems, digital assistants, vertical directories and social networks that consumers rely upon today; •create and update search-optimized landing pages for their locations, professionals and events on their own websites; •encourage consumer reviews for inclusion on their landing pages; and •analyze how features in the platform drive consumer engagement and revenue for our customers. Industry Background Search Results Provide Direct Answers. Search that is powered by AI has grown significantly in recent years. Businesses are now able to leverage search to help consumers discover what they need directly on the search engine results page. Consumers Search Using Natural Language. Consumers are no longer just typing in individual keywords, but are also using natural language phrases and even asking specific, complex questions. Businesses need to be able to understand those questions and answer them accurately and directly. Facts About a Business Are Fundamental. Businesses spend significant sums on developing their brands and creating product and market awareness. When potential consumers reached through those efforts want to make a purchase, businesses need to be able to answer consumers' questions accurately and directly. Inaccurate or incomplete information may result in lost sales opportunities, negative brand experiences and organizational inefficiencies. Search Drives Commerce. When searching for a business, consumers need to know many relevant attributes such as qualifications of a wealth advisor, amenities at a hotel, or course offerings at a university. As a result, businesses must ensure that the facts about their business are available, accurate and consistent online so that they can be found. Moreover, businesses want to make sure that they appear prominently online when nearby consumers search for them. Finally, once a consumer reaches a business’s website ready to transact, the business must be ready to answer the consumer’s specific queries. Managing Facts Online Is Challenging Many businesses lack the capabilities to effectively control, structure and manage facts across the digital ecosystem where consumers discover businesses. This lack of management capability is due to several factors: •Lack of Control of Facts Online.

The Market The human capital management (“HCM”) technology market is one of the largest in the software industry. According to an International Data Corporation (“IDC”) market forecast report, titled “Worldwide Semiannual Software Tracker” published in May 2020, the global market for Human Capital Management applications was predicted to be $23.7 billion by 2024, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 5.1%. Our People Development Solutions Our people development solutions are comprehensive SaaS solutions that help organizations manage their recruiting, learning, performance, and HR administration processes. These solutions are supplemented by state-of-the-art analytics and reporting as well as a number of cross-product tools for employee profile management and e-learning content aggregation and delivery. We believe that our people development solutions deliver the following benefits: •Comprehensive Functionality. Our solutions provide a comprehensive approach to people development by offering products to address all stages of the employee lifecycle: recruiting, onboarding, learning, performance, succession, compensation, enterprise social collaboration, and HR administration processes. Employees use our solutions throughout their careers to engage in performance processes such as goal management, performance reviews, continuous feedback, competency assessments, and compensatory reviews; to complete job-specific and compliance-related training; to evaluate potential career changes, development plans, or succession processes; and to connect and collaborate with co-workers by leveraging enterprise social networking tools. Employee managers and HR managers use our solutions to perform their people development administrative responsibilities effectively throughout their employees’ careers. We believe our comprehensive, unified solutions enable our customers to align their people development processes and practices with their broader strategic goals. •Flexible and Highly Configurable. Our solutions offer substantial configurability that allow our customers to match the use of our software with their specific business processes and workflows. We also provide web services to facilitate the importing and exporting of data to and from other customer systems, such as enterprise resource planning and human resource information system solutions. Our customers can configure various features, functions, and work-flows in our solutions by business unit, division, department, region, location, job position, pay grade, cost center, or self-defined organizational unit. Our customers are able to adjust features to configure specific processes, such as performance review workflows or training approvals, to match their existing or desired practices. This high level of configurability means that custom coding projects generally are not required to meet the diverse needs of our customers. •Easy-to-Use, Personalized User Interface. Our solutions employ an intuitive user interface and may be personalized for the end user, typically based on position, division, pay grade, location, manager, and particular use of the solutions. This ease of use limits the need for end-user training, which we believe increases user adoption rates and usage. •Software-as-a-Service Solutions Lowers the Total Cost of Ownership and Speeds Delivery. Our solutions are accessible through a standard web browser and do not require the large investments in implementation time, personnel, hardware, and consulting that are typical of hosted or on-premise solutions. With a single code base to maintain, we are able to release improved functionality on a quarterly basis. This is a more rapid pace than most hosted or on-premise solution providers can afford to deliver. •Scalable to Meet the Needs of Organizations. Our solutions have been used by Fortune 100 companies since 2001. While the complex needs of these global corporations required us to build solutions that can scale to support large, geographically-distributed employee bases, our solutions are capable of supporting deployments of various sizes. •Insights and Predictive Analysis.

"ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. Company Overview Issuer Direct Corporation and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as “Issuer Direct”, the “Company”, “We” or “Our” unless otherwise noted. Our corporate offices are located at One Glenwood Ave., Suite 1001, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27603. We announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website, SEC filings, investor events, news and earnings releases, public conference calls, webcasts and social media. We use these channels to communicate with our investors and the public about our company, our products and services and other related matters. It is possible that information we post on some of these channels could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media and others interested in Issuer Direct to review the information we post to all our channels, including our social media accounts. We are a premier provider of communications and compliance technology solutions that are designed to help organizations tell their stories globally. Our principal platform, Platform id.™, empowers users by thoughtfully integrating the most relevant tools, technologies and products, thus eliminating the complexity associated with producing and distributing their business communications and financial information. Platform id. efficiently and effectively helps our customers manage their events when seeking to distribute their messaging to key constituents, investors, markets and regulatory systems around the globe. Platform id. consists of several related but distinct communications and compliance modules that companies utilize every quarter. As our cloud-based subscription business continues to mature, we expect the communications portion of our business to continue to increase over the next several years, both in terms of overall revenue and as compared to the compliance portion of our business. Therefore, as noted below, we have begun to report our revenue as Communications and Compliance revenues rather than Platform & Technology and Services revenues as we have done in the past. Communications revenues grew to 64% of total revenue during 2020, compared to 57% and 45% of our revenue for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, growth from our Communications business was led by the market demands for our events products that were upgraded to handle virtual needs in the industry, as well as our ACCESSWIRE news brand, which drove both subscriptions and pay-as-you-go revenues higher than in prior years. We plan to continue to invest in our Platform id. communications offerings as well as additional offerings that we intend to incorporate into our Communications product lineup. Within most of our target markets, customers require several individual services and/or software providers to meet their investor relations, communications and compliance needs. We believe Platform id. can address all these needs in a single, secure, cloud-based platform - one that offers a customer control, increases efficiencies, demonstrates clear value and, most importantly, delivers consistent and compliant messaging from one centralized platform. We work with a diverse customer base, which includes not only corporate issuers and private companies, but also investment banks, professional firms, such as investor relations and public relations firms, as well as the accounting and legal communities. Our customers and their service providers utilize Platform id. and related solutions from document creation all the way to dissemination to regulatory bodies, news outlets, financial platforms and our customer’s shareholders. Private companies primarily use our news distribution and webcasting products and services to disseminate their message globally. Platform id.’s intelligent subscription platform guides thousands of customers through the process of communicating their message to a large audience. We also work with several select stock exchanges by making available certain parts of our platform under agreements to integrate our offerings within their products. We believe such partnerships will continue to yield increased exposure to a targeted customer base that could impact our revenue and overall brand in the market. In the past we have disclosed revenues in two main categories: (i) Platform and Technology and (ii) Services. However, to be more reflective of our strategy of primarily being a communications company, we have decided to re-categorize and disclose our revenues in the following two main categories: (i) Communications and (ii) Compliance. Set forth below is an infographic depicting the products included in each of these two main categories we provide today: Communications Our communications platform consists of our newswire, ACCESSWIRE, our webcasting and events business, professional conference and events software, as well as our investor relations website technology. These products are sold as the leading part of our Platform id. subscription, as well as individually to customers around the globe and further described below. ACCESSWIRE Our press release offering, which is marketed under the brand ACCESSWIRE, is a cost-effective, news dissemination and media outreach service. The ACCESSWIRE product offering focuses on press release distribution for both private and public companies globally. We believe ACCESSWIRE is becoming a competitive alternative to the traditional newswires because we have been able to use our technological advancements to allow customers to self-edit releases or use our editorial staff as desired to edit releases. We also continue to expand our distribution points, improve our targeting and enhance our analytics reporting. During 2020 we released a new e-commerce element to our ACCESSWIRE product, whereby customers can self-select their distribution and then register, upload their press release and tell their story in minutes without contacting a sales or operational employee. We believe the above strategy will enable us to continue to add new customers in 2021 and beyond. We have also been able to maintain high gross margins while providing our customers flexible pricing, with options to pay per release or enter longer-term, flat-fee subscriptions. Currently, ACCESSWIRE is available within our Platform id. subscription, or as a stand-alone offering. Like other newswires globally, ACCESSWIRE is dependent upon several key partners for its news distribution. Disruption in any of our partnerships could have a materially adverse impact on ACCESSWIRE and our overall business. ACCESSWIRE revenues and customers have increased each year compared to the prior year, a trend we expect to continue over the next several...","We are a premier provider of communications and compliance technology solutions that are designed to help organizations tell their stories globally.

"Item 1. Business. Elastic is a search company. Search is foundational to a wide variety of experiences. Elastic makes the power of search-the ability to instantly find relevant information and insights from large amounts of data-available for a diverse set of applications and solutions, including Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security. Elastic powers the search behind a ride sharing app to help locate nearby riders and drivers. Elastic powers the search for finding the right products to add to your cart for an ecommerce application. Elastic powers the search for a digital creative software company, enabling users to search across millions of digital assets to find the right photo, font, or color palette to complete a creative project. Elastic powers the logging of billions of events per day to track and manage website performance issues and network outages of a telecommunications company with nationwide networks of mobile subscribers. Elastic powers the processing of terabytes of daily data in real time to monitor the usage of thousands of servers for a financial services company across their entire IT environments. Elastic powers a university’s cybersecurity operations to protect thousands of devices and critical data. All of this is search. Why we search remains constant: we’re looking for insight, information, and answers. But how and what we search changes over time, from the Dewey Decimal System for libraries to Google for the World Wide Web to conversations with virtual assistants for everyday inquiries. Today, what we search has grown to include a rapidly increasing amount of structured and unstructured data from a multitude of sources such as databases, websites, applications, and mobile and connected devices. While search experiences often begin with search boxes, they are not confined to them. Dragging your finger across a map on a smartphone screen is search. Zooming into a specific time frame in a histogram is search. Mining log files for errors is search. Forecasting storage capacity two weeks into the future is search. Using natural language processing to analyze user sentiment is search. Elastic created the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source, and in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization in milliseconds or less. Developers build on top of the Elastic Stack to apply the power of search to their data and solve business problems. We have also built software solutions on the Elastic Stack that address a wide variety of use cases: Elastic Enterprise Search for workplace search, app search and site search, Elastic Observability for logging, metrics and application performance management (“APM”), and Elastic Security for security information and event management (“SIEM”) and endpoint security. The Elastic Stack and our solutions are designed to run in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments. As the technology landscape shifts, our products grow and adapt. In that sense, we believe that our company is truly elastic. Our origins are rooted in open source, which facilitates rapid adoption of our software and enables efficient distribution of our technology. Developers can either download or deploy our software directly in the cloud as a managed offering on our website, for use in development and production environments. Our offerings include both free and paid products and solutions. Our business model is based on a combination of free and paid proprietary software. For self-managed users who download our products, we make some of the proprietary features of our software available for free. Other proprietary features are only available through paid subscriptions, which also include access to support on all free and paid features. We also provide our software as a service (“SaaS”). There is no free subscription tier in our SaaS offerings. Unlike some open source companies, we do not build a separate enterprise version of an original open source project. Instead, we develop and test one robust codebase, over which we maintain control. We believe that maintaining full control over the source code enables us to develop better products for our users and customers. Our sales and marketing efforts start with developers and other users who have already adopted our software and then evolve to departmental decision-makers and senior executives who have broad purchasing power in their organizations. All of these actions help us build a powerful commercial business model. Our customers often significantly expand their usage of our products over time. Expansion includes increasing the number of developers using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and applying our products to new use cases. We focus some of our direct sales efforts on encouraging these types of expansion within our customer base. Our business has experienced rapid growth around the world. As of April 30, 2021, we had over 15,000 customers compared to over 11,300 customers and over 8,100 customers as of April 30, 2020 and April 30, 2019, respectively. Our revenue was $608.5 million in the year ended April 30, 2021, $427.6 million in the year ended April 30, 2020, and $271.7 million in the year ended April 30, 2019, representing year-over-year growth of 42% and 57% for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Subscriptions accounted for 93%, 92% and 91% of our total revenue in the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue from outside the United States accounted for 45%, 43% and 43% of our total revenue in the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of $129.4 million, $167.2 million and $102.3 million, respectively.

We conduct and plan to continue to conduct our activities in such a manner as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).

Your rights as a holder of shares, and the fiduciary duties of the Company’s Board of Directors and executive officers, and any limitations relating thereto are set forth in the documents governing the Company and may differ from those applying to a Delaware corporation. However, the documents governing the Company specify that the duties of its directors and officers will be generally consistent with the duties of a director of a Delaware corporation. The Company’s Board of Directors will oversee the management of the Company and our businesses. Initially, the Company’s Board of Directors will be comprised of seven (7) directors, with five (5) of those directors appointed by holders of the Company’s Class A common stock and two (2) of those directors appointed by holders of the Company’s Class B common stock, and at least five (5) of whom will be the Company’s independent directors. We have accumulated a deficit of $11,030,550 as of December 31, 2020 and will likely require significant additional capital to implement our business plan. Business Strategy and Core Strengths We anticipate that the operating businesses we acquire will be managed on a decentralized basis with essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and minimal involvement by the Company’s corporate senior management teams in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. The Company’s corporate senior management team anticipates that it will participate in and have ultimate responsibility for significant decisions, such as capital allocation, investment activities and the selection of a chief executive officer for each of the operating businesses. We will also be responsible for establishing, implementing and monitoring corporate governance policies and practices, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. We expect that our business activities at the holding company level will be are managed by a small senior corporate management team, who will research and identify attractive investment opportunities; delegate responsibilities to competent and motivated managers; set operating subsidiary goals; assist managers in the achievement of those goals; define risk parameters; develop appropriate incentive programs; and monitor progress against long-term objectives. We believe that our outlook on length of ownership and active management on our part may alleviate the concern that many stakeholders in potential control transactions may have with regard to their businesses going through multiple sale processes in a short period of time. We believe this outlook reduces both the risk that securities or whole businesses may be sold at unfavorable points in the overall market cycle and enhances our ability to develop a comprehensive strategy to grow the earnings and cash flows of each of our businesses, which we expect will better enable us to meet our long-term corporate objectives of increasing shareholder value. Our objective is to grow intrinsic value per share at an attractive rate by retaining capital to reinvest in the productive capabilities of our current subsidiaries, make opportunistic investments, and/or invest in new, anticipated durable earnings streams. Each of these options for capital will be compared to one another on a regular basis, and capital will be deployed according to our management’s judgment as to where it believes allocated capital has the potential to achieve the best long-term return. Investment Strategy We will seek to focus on acquiring operating businesses and securities that (a) can be purchased at what we believe to be a fair price relative to intrinsic value, (b) are managed by competent and incentivized management teams, (c) offer reasonable downside protection and (d) directly contribute to the Company’s strategic goals. Over time, we believe that a focus on these objectives should allow us to consistently deliver targeted investment returns that outperforms the broader market. We plan to target investments into businesses that we believe (i) operate in industries with stable long-term operating profiles, (ii) present a stable unlevered free cash flow profile, (iii) have the ability to quickly adapt to changing economic cycles and (iv) face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence. We believe that an investment strategy focused on investments with these character traits coupled with a value investing orientation should continue to present attractive investment opportunities that allow us to build a less correlated portfolio of operating assets that provide shareholders with exposure to a mix of growth and acyclical operating assets that allow us to maximize shareholder value. Management Strategy Our management strategy involves the financial and operational management of the businesses that we anticipate acquiring in a manner that seeks to grow earnings and cash flow and, in turn increasing stockholder value. In general, we plan to oversee and support the management team of each of our businesses by, among other things: ● recruiting and retaining talented managers to operate our businesses by using structured incentive compensation programs, including minority equity ownership, tailored to each business; ● regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals: ● assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies: ● identifying and working with management to execute on attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; and ● forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to...","The Company is structured as a holding company with a business strategy focused on owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities. We conduct and plan to continue to conduct our activities in such a manner as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Therefore, no more than 40% of our total assets can be invested in investment securities, as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act.

"ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview Proofpoint is a leading next-generation cybersecurity company that enables primarily large and mid-sized organizations worldwide to protect the way their people work from advanced threats and compliance risks. Our integrated suite of products works together to help organizations build people-centric security and compliance programs. We provide threat protection, information protection, user protection, business ecosystem protection, and compliance solutions to address today’s rapidly changing threat and compliance landscape. Our solutions are built on a flexible, cloud-based platform and leverage proprietary technologies - including big data analytics, machine learning, deep content inspection, secure storage, advanced encryption, intelligent message routing, dynamic malware analysis, threat correlation, and virtual execution environments. Every company’s greatest asset and greatest security risk is its people. Cyberattacks have fundamentally shifted from targeting infrastructure to targeting people, relying on tricking users into running code, divulging their passwords, or even sending money or data. This transformation of the threat landscape manifests in nearly every form of cyber threat, from nation state advanced persistent threat (“APT”) actors relying on phishing, through to cybercriminals launching massive ransomware email campaigns, and more targeted campaigns designed to steal valuable data from both legacy and cloud-based systems. At the same time, the rapid adoption of cloud applications has increased organizations’ attack surface by moving both threats and sensitive data away from the traditional network perimeter, reducing the effectiveness of many existing security products. These factors have contributed to an increasing number of severe data breaches and expanding regulatory mandates, notably the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), all of which have accelerated demand for effective threat protection and compliance solutions. Our platform addresses this growing challenge by not only protecting data as it flows into and out of the enterprise via on-premises and cloud-based email, social media, and other cloud applications, but also by keeping track of this information as it is modified and distributed throughout the enterprise for compliance and data loss prevention, and securely archiving these communications for compliance and discovery. We help organizations reduce their critical risk in five major ways: • Protecting users from the advanced attacks that target them via email, web, networks, social media, and cloud apps; • Preventing the theft or inadvertent loss of sensitive information and, in turn, ensuring compliance with regulatory data protection mandates; • Improving the resilience of end users to the threats that target them and training them to be better caretakers of their organizations’ critical data; • Collecting, retaining, supervising and discovering communications and sensitive data for compliance and litigation support; and • Enabling organizations to respond quickly to security issues, providing both the intelligence and the context to prioritize incidents and orchestrate remediation actions. Our platform and its associated solutions are sold to customers on a subscription basis and can be deployed through our unique cloud-based architecture that leverages both our global data centers as well as optional points-of-presence behind our customers’ firewalls. Our flexible deployment model enables us to deliver superior security and compliance while maintaining the favorable economics afforded by cloud computing, creating a competitive advantage for us over legacy on-premises and cloud-only offerings. We were founded in 2002 to provide a unified solution to help enterprises address their growing data security requirements. Our first solution was commercially released in 2003 to combat the burgeoning problem of spam and viruses and their impact on corporate email systems. To address the evolving threat landscape and the adoption of communication and collaboration systems beyond corporate email and networks, we have broadened our solutions to defend against a wide range of threats, including email, mobile apps and social media, to protect the information people create from both compromise and compliance risks, and to archive and govern corporate information. We market and sell our solutions worldwide both directly through our sales teams and indirectly through a hybrid model where our sales organization actively assists our network of distributors and resellers. We also distribute our solutions through strategic partners. Proofpoint Solutions Our integrated suite of on-demand security-as-a-service solutions enables large and mid-sized organizations to protect people throughout the enterprise from advanced attacks and compliance risks. Our comprehensive platform provides a secure email gateway, advanced threat protection, security awareness training, threat intelligence, email authentication, email encryption, data loss prevention, digital risk protection, cloud application protection, web browser isolation, archiving, e-discovery, and threat response capabilities. These solutions are built on a cloud-based architecture, protecting enterprises and their customers from inbound threats via email, social media, and mobile apps, while identifying and protecting enterprise data not only where it is stored within the enterprise but also as it transits beyond the organization’s borders such as via email or social media. We have pioneered the use of innovative technologies to deliver better ease-of-use, greater protection against the latest advanced threats, and lower total cost of ownership than traditional alternatives. The key elements of our solution include: • Superior protection against both advanced and targeted threats. We use a combination of proprietary technologies for big data analytics, machine learning, deep content inspection, static and dynamic malware analysis, protocol analysis, threat correlation, threat intelligence extraction, and virtual execution environments to predictively and actively detect and stop targeted “spear phishing” and other sophisticated advanced threats, including malicious attachments, polymorphic threats, zero-day exploits, user-transparent “drive-by” downloads, malicious web links, hybrid threats (such as links inserted into attached files), malware free attacks like impostor threats and credential phishing, and other penetration tactics. By processing, analyzing and correlating billions of data points on a daily basis, we can recognize anomalies in order to predictively detect targeted attacks before users are exposed. Our deep content inspection technology enables us to identify malicious message attachments and distinguish between valid messages and “phishing” messages designed to look authentic and trick the end user into divulging sensitive data or clicking on a malicious web link. Our machine learning technology enables us to detect targeted “zero-hour” attacks in real-time, even if they have not been seen previously at other locations, and quarantine them appropriately.

"Item 1. Business Overview We founded CrowdStrike in 2011 to reinvent security for the cloud era. When we started the company, cyberattackers had a decided, asymmetric advantage over existing security products. We turned the tables on the adversaries by taking a fundamentally new approach that leverages the network effects of crowdsourced data applied to modern technologies such as AI, cloud computing, and graph databases. Realizing that the nature of cybersecurity problems had changed but the solutions had not, we built our CrowdStrike Falcon platform to detect threats and stop breaches. We believe we are defining a new category called the Security Cloud, with the power to transform the security industry much the same way the cloud has transformed the customer relationship management, human resources, and service management industries. With our Falcon platform, we created the first multi-tenant, cloud native, intelligent security solution capable of protecting workloads across on-premise, virtualized, and cloud-based environments running on a variety of endpoints such as desktops, laptops, servers, virtual machines, cloud workloads, cloud containers, mobile, and IoT devices. Our Falcon platform is composed of two tightly integrated proprietary technologies: our easily deployed intelligent lightweight agent and our cloud-based, dynamic graph database called Threat Graph. Our solution benefits from crowdsourcing and economies of scale, which we believe enables our AI algorithms to be uniquely effective. We call this cloud-scale AI. Our single lightweight agent is installed on each endpoint or the cloud workload and provides local detection and prevention capabilities while also intelligently collecting and streaming high fidelity data to our platform for real-time decision-making. Our Threat Graph processes, correlates, and analyzes this data in the cloud using a combination of AI and behavioral pattern-matching techniques. By analyzing and correlating information across our massive, crowdsourced dataset, we are able to deploy our AI algorithms at cloud-scale and build a more intelligent, effective solution to detect threats and stop breaches that on-premise or single instance cloud products cannot match. Today, we offer 19 cloud modules and our Falcon platform via a SaaS subscription-based model that spans multiple large markets, including corporate workload security, security and vulnerability management, managed security services, IT operations management, threat intelligence services, identity protection and log management. Organizations everywhere are becoming more distributed as they adopt the cloud, increase workforce mobility, and grow their number of connected devices. They are adding more workloads to a myriad of different endpoints beyond the traditional security perimeter, exposing an increasingly broad attack surface to adversaries. In addition, the sophistication of cyberattacks has increased, often coming from nation-states, well-funded criminal organizations, and hackers using advanced, easily obtained methods of attack. On a number of occasions, adversaries have launched devastating, destructive attacks that have caused significant business disruption and billions of dollars in cumulative losses. The architectural limitations of legacy security products, coupled with a dynamic and intensifying threat landscape, are creating the need for a fundamentally new approach to security. Our pioneering approach starts with our single intelligent lightweight agent that enables frictionless deployment of our platform at scale. Our customers can rapidly adopt our technology across any type of workload running on a variety of endpoints. Our lightweight agent offloads computationally intensive tasks to the cloud, while retaining local detection and prevention capabilities that are necessary on the endpoint. The agent is nonintrusive to the end user and continues to protect the endpoint and track activity even when offline. The agent recommences transmitting data to our Falcon platform when the connection to the cloud has been reestablished. By utilizing CrowdStrike’s single agent, customers are able to leverage the capabilities of our platform without burdening the endpoint with multiple agents. Our lightweight agent intelligently streams high fidelity endpoint data to the cloud where Threat Graph provides a simple, flexible, and scalable way to model highly interconnected data sets. Threat Graph processes, correlates, and analyzes over five trillion endpoint-related events per week in real time and maintains an index of these events for future use. Threat Graph continuously looks for malicious activity by applying graph analytics and AI algorithms to the data streamed from the endpoints. Our multi-tenant architecture allows us to collect a broad array of high fidelity data about both potential attacks and benign behavioral patterns across our entire customer base, continuously enhancing our AI algorithms. This significantly increases the efficacy of our solution to stop breaches while reducing false positives. We founded our company on the principle that the future of security would be driven by AI and that a cloud-native architecture would enable the collection of high fidelity data and scalability necessary for an effective solution. From the beginning, our strategy was focused on collecting data at scale, centrally storing such data in a singular model, and training our algorithms on these vast amounts of high fidelity data, which we believe is a fundamental differentiator from our competitors. Our cloud-scale AI means that the more data that is fed into our Falcon platform, the more intelligent Threat Graph becomes and the more our customers benefit, creating a powerful network effect that increases the overall value we provide. AI is revolutionizing many technology fields, including security solutions. To be truly effective, algorithms that enable AI depend on the quality and volume of data that trains them and the selection of the right differentiating features from that data. Our proprietary algorithms in Threat Graph identify events that may or may not be directly related, but together could indicate a threat that could otherwise remain undetected. We are uniquely effective because we not only have a massive amount of high fidelity data to train our AI models but also because of our deep security expertise to guide our feature selection-all resulting in industry-leading efficacy and low false positives. Our rich set of continuously collected high fidelity endpoint data feeding our algorithms also enables us to use an active learning approach, where the models are continuously updated to fill in gaps identified in initial models and their performance is validated with this data prior to production use.

Our real estate division invests in Opportunity Zones, Affordable Housing, and specialized real estate properties. Business History GiveMePower Corporation (the “PubCo” or “Company”), a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on June 7, 2001 to sell software geared to end users and developers involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products located in Canada and the United States. The PubCo has been dormant and non-operating since year 2009. PubCo is a public reporting company registered with the Securities Exchange Commissioner (“SEC”). In November 2009, the Company filed Form 15D, Suspension of Duty to Report, and as a result, the Company was not required to file any SEC forms since November 2009. On December 31, 2020, PubCo sold one Special 2019 series A preferred share (“Series A Share”) for $38,000 to Goldstein Franklin, Inc. (“Goldstein”), a California corporation. One Series A Share is convertible to 100,000,000 shares of common stocks at any time. The Series A Share also provided with 60% voting rights of the PubCo. On the same day, Goldstein sold one-member unit of Alpharidge Capital, LLC (“Alpharidge”), a California limited liability corporation, representing 100% member owner of Alpharidge. As a result, Alpharidge become a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo as of December 31, 2020. The Company’s operating structure did not change as a result of the change of control, however, following the transaction on December 31, 2019, in which Goldstein Franklin, Inc. acquired control of the Company, Goldstein transferred one of its operating subsidiaries, Alpharidge Capital LLC into GMPW to become one of the Company’s operating subsidiaries. Alpharidge Capital LLC (“Alpharidge”) was formed under the laws of the State of California on August 30, 2019. Alpharidge has two distinct lines of businesses that comprise: (1) a specialty biopharmaceutical holding company focused on building portfolio of real estate investment properties and equity positions in select companies within select industries; and (2) an event-driven investment management operation that invests in equities, warrants, bonds and options of public and private companies in America and across the globe. Prior to the transaction, the Company sell software geared to end users and developers involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products located in Canada and the United States. On September 16, 2020, as part of its sales of unregistered securities to Kid Castle Educational Corporation, company related to, and controlled by GMPW President and CEO, the Company, for $3 in cash and 1,000,000 shares of its preferred stock, acquired 100% interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC (“CED Capital”), a California Limited Liability Company, and 97% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (“CBDX”), a California corporation. This transaction was accounted for under the Consolidation Method using the variable interest entity (VIE) model wherein the Company consolidates all investees operating results if the Company expects to assume more than 50% of another entity’s expected losses or gains. The 1,000,000 shares of our preferred stock sold to Kid Castle Educational Corporation gave to Kid Castle, approximately 87% voting control of Givemepower Corporation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company therefore include its wholly owned subsidiaries of Alpharidge Capital LLC. (“Alpharidge”), Community Economic Development Capital, LLC. (“CED Capital”), and Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (“CBDX”), and subsidiaries, in which GiveMePower has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities (“VIE”) provisions of ASC 810, “Consolidation” (“ASC 810”), after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts.

Through March 31, 2021, Digital Turbine's technology platform has been adopted by over 35 mobile operators and device original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") and has delivered more than 5.3 billion application preloads for tens of thousands of advertising campaigns. The Company operates this business as one operating and reportable segment - Media Distribution, which was previously referred to as the operating segment O&O (which refers to operators and OEMs) and the reportable segment Advertising. As the Company's suite of product offerings expands, both organically and through acquisitions, we believe that this renaming of our reporting and operating segment better reflects the way management views the business. There are no changes or historical differences to product offerings and financial information that were referred to as the Advertising segment in prior periods. While advertising, in general, remains a focus of our Media Distribution segment, we feel that this change in name more accurately conveys to the reader what we do for our customers and partners. The Company's Media Distribution business consists of products and services that simplify the discovery and delivery of mobile applications and content media for consumers. •Application Media represents the portion of the business where our platform delivers apps to end users through partnerships with carrier networks and OEMs. Application Media optimizes revenues by using developed technology to streamline, track, and manage app install demand from hundreds of application developers across various publishers, carriers, OEMs, and devices. •Content Media represents the portion of the business where our platform presents news, weather, sports, and other content directly within the native device experience (e.g., as the start page in the mobile browser, a widget, on unlock, etc.) through partnerships with carrier networks and OEMs. Content Media optimizes revenue by a combination of: ◦Programmatic Ad Partner Revenue - advertising within the content media that’s sold on an ad exchange at a market rate (CPM - Cost Per Thousand); ◦Sponsored Content - sponsored content media from 3rd party content providers, presented similarly to an ad, that is monetized when a recommended story is viewed (CPC - Cost Per Click); ◦Editorial Content - owned or licensed media, presented similarly to an ad, that is monetized when the media is clicked on (CPC - Cost Per Click).

MGT is comprised of the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary MGT Sweden AB. MGT’s corporate office is in Raleigh, North Carolina. Cryptocurrency Mining Business Industry Summary Bitcoin is a world-recognized cryptocurrency, which can be traded and converted into major fiat currencies on cryptocurrency exchanges. Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange that are transacted through and recorded on a decentralized distributed ledger system, called the “Blockchain.” The Blockchain is built by a chronological addition of transactions, which are grouped into blocks. Each new block requires a mathematical problem to be solved before it can be confirmed and added to the Blockchain. The processing power used to solve these mathematical problems is measured by Hash Rate or Hashes per second (“H/s”). The complexity of these problems, also referred to as mining difficulty, increases with the network’s growing Hash Rate. Bitcoin mining entails solving these complex mathematical problems using custom designed and programmed application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) computers (also referred to as “miners”). Bitcoin miners perform a vital function on the Bitcoin Blockchain network, by performing these calculations and adding transaction blocks to the Blockchain ledger. When a miner is successful in adding a block to the Blockchain, it is rewarded with a fixed number of Bitcoin; a miner can also be compensated by network transaction fees. Additional information about Bitcoin, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies can be found on publicly available educational sources such as www.Bitcoin.org. Our Operations Cryptocurrency mining Following a review of its Bitcoin mining operations in early 2019, we determined to consolidate our activities in a Company-owned and managed facility. Central to this strategy was the purchase of land in LaFayette, GA and the entry into a favorable contract for electricity in the second quarter of 2019. Located adjacent to a utility substation, the several acre property has access to over 20 megawatts (MW) of low-cost power. The Company owned approximately 669 and 649 Antminer S17 Pro Bitcoin miners located in LaFayette, GA as of December 31, 2020 and April 15, 2021, respectively. All miners were purchased from Bitmaintech Pte. Ltd., a Singapore limited company (“Bitmain”), and are collectively rated at approximately 30 Ph/s in computing power. Bitmain has acknowledged manufacturing defects, combined with inadequate repair facilities, rendering approximately one half of our miners in need of repair or replacement. The Company’s miners are housed in three modified shipping containers. The Company’s current electrical load is estimated at under 1.0 MW. The entire facility, including the land, two 2500 KVA 3-phase transformers, the mining containers, and miners, are owned by MGT. As the Company is presently using only a portion of the built-out available electrical load, it is exploring ways to grow and maintain its current operations including but not limited to further equipment sales, leasing space to other Bitcoin miners, and raising capital to acquire newest generation miners. Prior to establishing our Company-owned and managed facility, we conducted our Bitcoin mining operations through third-party hosting arrangements. We also entered into management agreements with third party investors whereby the investors purchased the mining hardware, and we received both a fee to manage the mining operations plus one-half of the net operating profit. In March 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement to terminate our hosting agreement in Washington and conveyed ownership of its onsite mining assets for full satisfaction of $77 in outstanding hosting service fees. In August and September 2019, we terminated all our management agreements with third party investors, and in December 2019, we terminated our final remaining hosting arrangements in Colorado and Ohio. Bitcoin And Blockchain Overview A Bitcoin is one type of a digital asset that is issued by, and transmitted through, an open source, math-based protocol platform using cryptographic security (the “Bitcoin Network”). The Bitcoin Network is an online, peer-to-peer user network that hosts the public Blockchain transaction ledger and the source code that comprises the basis for the cryptography and math-based protocols governing the Bitcoin Network. No single entity owns or operates the Bitcoin Network, the infrastructure of which is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base. Bitcoin can be used to pay for goods and services or can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar, at rates determined on Bitcoin exchanges or in individual peer to peer end-user-to-end-user transactions. Bitcoins are “stored” or reflected on the Blockchain in a decentralized manner on the computers of each Bitcoin Network user. The Blockchain records the transaction history of all Bitcoin in existence and, through the transparent reporting of transactions, allows the Bitcoin Network to verify the association of each Bitcoin with the digital wallet that owns it. The Bitcoin Network and Bitcoin software programs can interpret the Blockchain to determine the exact Bitcoin balance, if any, of any digital wallet listed in the Blockchain as having taken part in a transaction on the Bitcoin Network. The Bitcoin Network, being decentralized, does not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create, transmit or determine the value of Bitcoin. Rather, Bitcoin are created and allocated by the Bitcoin Network protocol through a “mining” process subject to a strict, well-known issuance schedule. The value of Bitcoin is determined by the supply and demand of Bitcoin in the Bitcoin exchange market (and in private peer to peer transactions), as well as the number of merchants that accept it. As Bitcoin transactions can be broadcast to the Bitcoin Network by any user’s Bitcoin software and Bitcoin can be transferred without the involvement of intermediaries or third parties, there are only minor transaction costs in direct peer-to-peer transactions on the Bitcoin Network. Third party service providers such as Bitcoin exchanges and third party payment processing services may charge significant fees for processing transactions and for converting, or facilitating the conversion of, Bitcoin to or from fiat currency. Miners dedicate substantial resources to mining. Given the increasing difficulty of the target established by the...","MGT was originally incorporated in Utah in 1977.

Bitcoin miners perform a vital function on the Bitcoin Blockchain network, by performing these calculations and adding transaction blocks to the Blockchain ledger. When a miner is successful in adding a block to the Blockchain, it is rewarded with a fixed number of Bitcoin; a miner can also be compensated by network transaction fees. Our Operations Cryptocurrency mining Following a review of its Bitcoin mining operations in early 2019, we determined to consolidate our activities in a Company-owned and managed facility. The Bitcoin Network is an online, peer-to-peer user network that hosts the public Blockchain transaction ledger and the source code that comprises the basis for the cryptography and math-based protocols governing the Bitcoin Network. The Bitcoin Network and Bitcoin software programs can interpret the Blockchain to determine the exact Bitcoin balance, if any, of any digital wallet listed in the Blockchain as having taken part in a transaction on the Bitcoin Network.","MGT is a Delaware corporation that operates in the cryptocurrency mining industry. The company owns and manages a facility in LaFayette, GA, where it houses approximately 649 Antminer S17 Pro Bitcoin miners with a computing power of approximately 30 Ph/s. MGT is exploring ways to grow and maintain its current operations, including equipment sales, leasing space to other Bitcoin miners, and raising capital to acquire newest generation miners. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital asset that is issued and transmitted through an open-source, math-based protocol platform using cryptographic security. The value of Bitcoin is determined by the supply and demand of Bitcoin in the Bitcoin exchange market.",0.17777777327565444,0.9101303906982326

"Item 1. Description of Business. Our Corporate Information We were organized in Texas in September 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in October 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 101 East Park Boulevard, Suite 1300, Plano, Texas 75074, and our telephone number is (972) 234-6400. Our website URL is www.intrusion.com. References to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”, “Intrusion” or “Intrusion Inc.” refer to Intrusion Inc. and its subsidiaries. TraceCop and Savant are trademarks of Intrusion Inc.. Our Business We develop, sell and support products that protect any-sized company or government organization by fusing advanced threat intelligence with real-time artificial intelligence to neutralize cyberattacks as they occur - including Zero-Day attacks. We market and distribute our solutions through a direct sales force and value-added resellers. Our end-user customers include U.S. federal government entities, state and local government entities, and companies ranging in size from mid-market to large enterprises. Our Solutions INTRUSION Shield tm INTRUSION Shield, our cornerstone cybersecurity solution is a comprehensive, real-time AI-based Security-as-a-Service that inspects and kills all dangerous network connections before they can do damage. What makes our approach unique is that it inspects every packet of inbound and outbound traffic and analyzes the reputation of the IP addresses (source and destination), the domain and ports it is communicating on, along with many other fields in the packet to neutralize malicious connections. Most breaches today are caused by malware free compromises that trigger no alarms in a firewall or endpoint solution. The common denominator is network , which Shield monitors and analyses, allowing Shield to identify and stop all attacks, even malware-free attacks. Shield’s capabilities continuously evolve based on constant machine learning and neural networking technology. Unlike traditional industry approaches that rely heavily on human mitigation and defensive approaches, which malicious actors and nation states have learned to bypass. Shield’s proprietary architecture isolates and neutralizes malicious traffic and network flows that existing solutions cannot identify before they harm a corporation or government organization. Shield is designed as a next generation Network Detection and Response solution. After 30 years of providing research, analysis, tools and services to the federal government and enterprise corporations, Intrusion possesses a comprehensive and proprietary data set of petabytes of Internet traffic, including information about the activities of malicious online actors. Shield integrates this rich TraceCop data set with artificial intelligence (AI) and Savant real-time process flow technology to provide our customers with a unique and affordable tool to detect, identify, and neutralize cyberattacks. In particular, the Shield AI has been specifically trained to identify and stop Zero-Day attacks and ransomware, the most prolific and crippling forms of malware today. INTRUSION TraceCop TM INTRUSION TraceCop is our big data tool with extensive IP intelligence canvassing the entire Internet. It contains largest repository of reputation information on known good and known bad active IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6). TraceCop contains an inventory of network selectors and enrichments useful to support forensic investigations. The data contains a history of IPv4 and IPv6 block allocations and transfers, historical mappings of IP addresses to Autonomous Systems (ASNs) as observed through BGP, and approximately one billion historically registered domain names and registration context. TraceCop contains tens of billions of historic DNS resolutions of Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs or hostnames) on each of these domains. Together, this shows relationships, hosting, and attribution for Internet resources. TraceCop also contains web server content surveys of content, such as natural language and topic of the content on hundreds of millions of websites and servers and OS fingerprints of services showing applications running on an IP. This context allows Shield to assess the use and purpose of an Internet resource. TraceCop also contains a history of threat and reputation for each hostname and IP address over time. All this makes it a very effective network forensics and cybersecurity analysis tool to inform Shield. INTRUSION Savant TM INTRUSION Savant is a network monitoring solution that leverages the rich data available in TraceCop to identify suspicious traffic in real-time. Savant uses several original patents to uniquely characterize and record all network flows. Savant is a network reconnaissance and attack analysis tool used by forensic analysts in the DoD, Federal Government and corporations with in-house threat research teams. For example, Savant users can create various automated rules to inspect packets matching (or not) certain criteria such as creating a rule to ensure the Source MAC address field in the Ethernet header and Source IP address from the IP header are always the same, failing which could indicate MAC or IP Spoofing in progress. Similarly, threat investigators can create rules using regular expressions by combining multiple fields in the packet headers. Ultimately, the rich capabilities of Savant provides the real-time analysis that Shield uses to make decisions on whether or not a packet is malicious. Our Intellectual Property and Licenses Our success and our ability to compete are dependent, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We principally rely on a combination of contractual rights, trade secrets and copyright laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our solutions. In addition, we have received two patents, and we are in the process of applying for patents for our Shield family of solutions. We have also entered into non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers, resellers, and certain customers to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology, although it would be extremely difficult to replicate the proprietary and comprehensive internet databases we have developed over the past 24 years. We have entered into software and solution license agreements with various suppliers. These license agreements provide us with additional software and hardware components that add value to our cybersecurity solutions.

Market-based compensation and benefits, adjusted to account for the specific states, provinces and countries in which we operate in North America, facilitate retention of the right people. Training provides our people with the skills they need to succeed in technology and in serving our public sector customers. Internal development opportunities, both in our business units and at GTY, facilitate career development and satisfaction from individual contributors to management to executives. We were initially formed as a blank check company incorporated on August 11, 2016 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Until the consummation of the business combination in 2019, we neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue. On November 1, 2016, we consummated our initial public offering of 55,200,000 units, including the issuance of 7,200,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each unit consisted of one Class A ordinary share and one-third of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitled the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $552 million. Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, in August 2016, GTY Investors, LLC (the “Sponsor”) purchased 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares (“founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share. On each of October 14 and October 26, 2016, we effected a share capitalization resulting in an aggregate of 11,500,000 and 13,800,000 founder shares outstanding, respectively. In October 2016, the Sponsor transferred 25,000 founder shares to each of our independent director nominees at the same per-share purchase price paid by the Sponsor. Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 8,693,334 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, with the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of approximately $13.04 million. Upon the closing of the initial public offering and private placement on November 1, 2016, $552 million from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Initially, we were required to complete our initial business combination by November 1, 2018, which was 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. On October 30, 2018, our shareholders approved a proposal to amend our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which we had to consummate an initial business combination from November 1, 2018 to May 1, 2019. In connection with such proposal, our public shareholders had the right to elect to redeem their Class A ordinary shares for a per share price, payable in cash, based upon the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. Our public shareholders holding 34,011,538 Class A ordinary shares out of a total of 55,200,000 Class A ordinary shares validly elected to redeem their shares and, accordingly, after giving effect to such redemptions, the balance in our trust account was approximately $216.8 million. On February 19, 2019, we consummated the business combination pursuant to which we acquired Bonfire, CityBase, eCivis, Open Counter, Questica, and Sherpa (the “Acquisition”). Until the Acquisition, GTY Technology Holdings Inc., a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands (“GTY Cayman”) did not engage in any operations nor generate any revenues. 11,073,040 Class A ordinary shares were redeemed at a per share price of approximately $10.29 in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the business combination. In connection with the closing of the business combination, GTY Govtech, Inc. a Massachusetts corporation, became the parent company of and successor issuer by operation of Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act to our predecessor entity, GTY Cayman, and changed its name from GTY Govtech, Inc. to GTY Technology Holdings Inc. Upon the closing of the business combination, all outstanding Class A ordinary shares were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for shares of common stock, and our outstanding warrants became exercisable for shares of common stock on the same terms as were contained in such warrants prior to the business combination.

"Item 1. Business Overview We are the enterprise platform for dynamic work, enabling teams and organizations of all sizes to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work at scale, resulting in more efficient processes and better business outcomes. The nature of work has changed and the majority of work is unstructured or dynamic. The growing volume and variety of information has complicated the process for executing work across teams that are increasingly multidisciplinary and geographically distributed. Unstructured or dynamic work is work that has historically been managed using a combination of email, spreadsheets, whiteboards, phone calls, and in-person meetings to communicate with team members and complete projects and processes. It is frequently changing, often ad-hoc, and highly reactive to new information. Rigid applications, such as ticketing, enterprise resource planning, or customer relationship management systems are poorly suited to manage unstructured work. For nearly 30 years, organizations have primarily relied on lightweight tools to manage dynamic or unstructured work. Reliance on these tools limits visibility and accountability, creates information silos that slow decision-making, and results in delays, errors, and suboptimal outcomes. Business users need technology solutions they can configure and modify on their own. Today, many systems within an enterprise require IT to implement and manage them. Most tools that focus on the business user require some coding knowledge to incorporate business logic for workflows, integrate data from third-party systems, and adapt to changing business needs. Smartsheet was founded in 2005 with a vision to build a universal application for work execution that does not require coding capabilities. Our platform serves as a single source of truth across work projects, processes, and initiatives and fosters accountability and engagement within teams, leading to more efficient decision-making and better business outcomes. Our platform provides a number of solutions that eliminate the obstacles to capturing information, including a familiar and intuitive spreadsheet interface as well as easily customizable forms. Our reporting and automation capabilities further increase speed by reducing time spent on administration and repetitive work. We make it easy for teams to apply business logic to automate repetitive actions using an extensive list of conditions. Business users, with little or no training, can configure and modify our platform to customize workflows to suit their needs. Our familiar and intuitive user interface and functionality allow users to realize the benefits of our platform without changing the behaviors developed using everyday productivity tools. People across organizations have similar needs no matter where they work or what they do. They need to manage workflows across teams, gain visibility into progress on company-wide projects and initiatives in real-time, capture inputs, track and report on deliverables, prioritize actions, and provide consistency in processes. Smartsheet is adaptable to manage virtually any type of work. Our customers use Smartsheet for thousands of documented use cases, including software migration planning, vendor and contract management, brand launches, compliance reporting, event planning, customer onboarding, budget approvals, patent application processing, talent acquisition, benefit and retirement tracking, sales enablement, pipeline management, sales operations, commissions calculations, marketing programs management, investor relations tracking, and website management, among others. Our customers include over 90 companies in the Fortune 100, and over 80% of the companies in the Fortune 500. As of January 31, 2021, our Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 customers had annualized contract values (“ACVs”) ranging from less than $200 to over $2.5 million, and approximately one fourth of our Fortune 500 customers had ACVs lower than $5,000 per year. Our customers typically begin using our platform for a single initiative or project. Over time, as users realize the benefits of improved execution, adoption of our platform expands across an organization through new use cases and teams. We deliver our cloud-based software platform through a subscription model. We have a digital sales model for self-service adoption through our website. We employ an efficient inside sales team that utilizes machine learning and lead scoring to respond to and convert other interested users within new and existing organizations.

We provide our customers with a robust set of capabilities to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work. Our platform enhances visibility and accountability in work execution and eliminates behaviors and processes that hinder productivity. We designed our platform to be accessible and valuable to all knowledge workers. Business users with no coding ability can share their work in Smartsheet across internal and external teams, and create and modify workflows to address specific use cases with our platform. Smartsheet offers multiple ways for customers to plan and manage their work using grids, projects, cards, and calendars; users can easily toggle between views to support their team’s preferred way of working. We also offer capabilities and functionality to enable teams to accelerate execution while maintaining the flexibility to apply our platform to thousands of documented use cases.

We were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations. We later began working with commercial enterprises. We have built two principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham (“Gotham”) and Palantir Foundry (“Foundry”). Gotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for. We later found that the challenges faced by commercial institutions when it came to working with data were fundamentally similar. An Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data. Our software is on the front lines, sometimes literally, and that means so are we. Gotham’s use has now extended beyond intelligence analysis into defense operations and mission planning. And Foundry is becoming the central operating system not only for individual institutions but for entire industries. The stakes are high. The challenges our platforms address are a matter of survival, both for the institutions we serve and the individuals who depend on them. We have the privilege of partnering with some of the world’s most important government and commercial organizations. And we believe that the work of those organizations is essential to our security and the lives that we lead. We are committed to ensuring that our software is as effective as possible without ever compromising our values. Our platforms were built from the start to protect individual privacy and prevent the misuse of information. We are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build software platforms that enable our customers to integrate their own data - data that they already have. The same technology that makes our software so analytically powerful - its ability to construct a model of the real world from countless data points - is what allows our customers to monitor, properly secure, and control access to that data and its use. It is also why customers, including governments around the world, trust our platforms to safeguard their data, including their most sensitive information. As of December 31, 2020, our platforms were used by 139 customers, including some of the largest and most significant institutions in the world. For example, the U.S. Army uses our software to ensure the readiness of more than one million military personnel and to make decisions across dozens of command structures. Similarly, our software is deployed by one of the world’s leading auto manufacturers across its factories in North America to help ensure quality control on the production line. Gotham and Foundry enable these institutions to transform massive amounts of information into an integrated data asset that reflects their operations. Users can build on top of this asset to make data accessible and actionable. Our platforms enable people, whether they are workers on an assembly line or soldiers in the field, to work with data, even if they have never written a line of code. We have also invested heavily in developing Apollo, our continuous delivery and product infrastructure platform, which is used to deliver software updates to our customers and enables our software to run in any environment. The investments in our software platforms have yielded a significant decrease in the time and number of engineers required to install and deploy our software. For instance, the time required to install our software and begin working with a customer has decreased more than five-fold from 2019 to 2020. In some cases, our customers can now be up and running in mere hours. Our software is used by customers across 40 industries and in more than 150 countries. Our government work is central to defense and intelligence operations in the United States and its allies abroad. On the commercial front, we work with some of the world’s most durable and important companies across industries, including in the consumer, energy, financial services, healthcare, industrials, telecommunications, and transportation sectors. We generated $1.1 billion in revenue in 2020, reflecting an increase of 47% from our revenue in 2019, which was $742.6 million. The scale of our partnerships with customers, in revenue terms, has also grown over time. In 2020, our average revenue per customer was $7.9 million, and the average revenue for our top twenty customers, by revenue generated in 2020, was $33.2 million. This is up from 2019, when our average revenue per customer was $5.6 million, and the average revenue from our top 20 customers, by revenue generated in 2019, was $24.8 million. The broader momentum of our business is the result of the strength of our software platforms. And the need for software that works has never been greater. The systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public - fractured healthcare systems, erosion of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars - will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the...","We were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations.

U.S. Patent #8,498,871, (“the ‘871”) entitled “Dynamic Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,” is a system for facilitating free form dictation, including directed dictation and constrained recognition and /or structured transcription among users having heterogeneous protocols for generating, transcribing and exchanging recognized and transcribed speech. U.S. Patent #9,142,217, (“the 217”) entitled “Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,” is an expansion of the coverage of the ‘871. U.S. Patent #9,934,786 (“the ‘786”) was issued April 3, 2018 and is an extension of the coverage in the ‘871 patent. Our business strategy is to attempt to interest other companies in entering into license agreements or other strategic relationships and to enforce and defend our patents through infringement and interference proceedings, as appropriate. Industry Overview We believe that speech recognition technology has a multitude of potential applications including but not limited to dictation and transcription, mobile messaging (voice to texting), server based web search, customer relations and translation. Speech recognition technology, which provides for the conversion of speech into written text, is the threshold feature of our solutions. Our technology focuses on improving speech recognition technology by increasing speech conversion precision, with the goal of achieving near 100% accuracy and allowing the user to speak naturally. We also focus on improving user productivity and profitability by enabling the user to effectively utilize the written text produced by speech recognition technology (the End-Text) in multiple applications specific to the user’s business purposes and goals. We believe our main competitors are Microsoft, Nuance, Google Voice, Amazon Alexa and Apple. We also compete, and anticipate that we will compete, with several smaller niche suppliers. Principal Proposed Products or Services We have not achieved any revenues from product sales. In addition, we will need substantial additional capital to achieve our marketing objectives as described below. Speech Recognition Software and Related Firmware Our principal proposed product is speech recognition software and related firmware which allows for dictation into a broad range of applications, including DOS applications running in Windows, UNIX and mainframe applications accessed through terminal emulation programs, various custom applications, and all Windows 3.x, 95, 98, 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 10 programs. Through this product, we seek to provide full functionality including audio proofreading, deferred and delegated correction and additional capabilities that we believe are not available with other products. This product is designed to allow for deferred dictation, where the text is saved with the associated audio, and the users can resume when stopped and can play back dictated content. Similarly, the recognized text and associated audio can be saved to be used when text is corrected. AVRS Enterprise Solutions AVRS patented technology is applicable to many main stream speech enabled applications ranging from traditional desktop applications to mobile, web-based and cloud solutions. The technology reaches beyond simple speech recognition and transcription into many other applications thus enabling the exchange of spoken text transcription amongst numerous users on diverse system platforms, as well as enabling the transcribed text to be utilized by many interface applications. The key is the recognition of, and in many cases the transcription of, spoken text in a myriad of applications to allow a seamless interface among users and /or systems having disparate protocols. Recognition of dictated speech including spoken text and commands, over many platforms provides operations of systems having diverse requirements and capabilities. AVRS patents cover both a method of implementation and a system whereby speech recognition and transcription can be operated upon and exchanged amongst users employing disparate legacy protocols through one or more transaction managers having a systems protocol. An underlying key factor in all AVRS patented technology lies in its enabling capability whereby any legacy application protocol can be made compatible with speech recognition and transcription engines with or without modification of the application or the protocol upon which the initiating or the receiving application relies. Market We believe that our patented technology has applications in vertical markets that require individuals and organizations to create reports, letters, e-mail, data entry, manuals, books, and virtually any other document or end product involving written data. These organizations include corporations, hospitals, medical product and service providers, governmental entities, legal professionals, sales and service organizations law enforcement agencies and mobile search and voicemail to text. Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) We believe that our patented technology has applications in OEM markets, targeting both software developers and hardware manufacturers. When we have sufficient available resources, we may approach the larger OEM companies with a joint marketing approach strategy while using a direct sale basis to approach small and medium-sized OEMs. Hardware Manufacturers We believe...","Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc.

"Item 1. Business. Overview We are a cloud-based provider of payroll and human capital management, or HCM, software solutions for medium-sized organizations, which we define as those having between 10 and 1,000 employees. Our comprehensive product suite delivers a unified platform to create a modern workplace for our clients and their employees through automation, data-driven insights and engagement. Excluding clients acquired through acquisitions, as of June 30, 2021, we provided our payroll and HCM software solutions to approximately 28,750 clients across the U.S., which on average had over 100 employees. Our multi-tenant software platform is highly configurable and includes a unified product suite for payroll, human capital management, workforce management, talent management, benefits, modern workforce solutions, and analytics & insights, to enable our clients to make strategic decisions all while promoting a modern workplace and improving employee engagement. Our payroll and HCM modules provide robust on-demand functionality, reporting and analytics. Our platform provides intuitive self-service functionality for employees and managers combined with seamless integration across all our solutions. We supplement our comprehensive software platform with an integrated implementation and client service organization, all of which are designed to meet the needs of our clients and prospects. Effective management of human capital is a core function in all organizations and requires a significant commitment of resources. Organizations are faced with complex and ever-changing requirements, including diverse federal, state and local regulations across multiple jurisdictions. In addition, the workplace operating environment is rapidly changing as employees increasingly become mobile, work remotely and expect an end user experience similar to that of consumer-oriented applications. Many companies also are operating without the infrastructure, expertise or personnel to implement or support large and complex systems in today’s dynamic environment. Existing solutions offered by third-party payroll service providers can have limited capabilities and configurability while other enterprise-focused software vendors can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to implement and manage. We believe that modern organizations are better served by modern SaaS solutions designed to meet their unique needs, deliver fast time to value and provide their employees with the most engaging experience available. Our solutions provide the following key benefits to our clients: ● Comprehensive payroll and HCM cloud-based platform built to connect with today’s workforce; ● Modern, intuitive user experience and self-service capabilities that significantly increase employee engagement; ● Flexible and configurable platform that aligns with business processes and centralizes payroll and HCM data; ● Software as a service, or “SaaS”, delivery model that reduces total cost of ownership for our clients; and ● Seamless data integration with our extensive partner ecosystem that saves time and expense and reduces the risk of errors. We market and sell our products through our direct sales force. We generate sales leads through a variety of focused marketing initiatives and from our extensive referral network of 401(k) advisors, benefits administrators, insurance brokers, third-party administrators and HR consultants. We derive revenue from a client based on the solutions purchased by the client, the number of client employees and the amount, type and timing of services provided with respect to those client employees. Our annual revenue retention rate was greater than 92% in each of the fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021. Our total revenues increased from $467.6 million in fiscal 2019 to $561.3 million in fiscal 2020, representing a 20% year-over-year increase and to $635.6 million in fiscal 2021, representing a 13% year-over-year increase. While the majority of our agreements with clients are generally cancellable on 60 days’ or less notice, we also have term agreements which are generally two years in length. Our recurring revenue model and high annual revenue retention rates provide significant visibility into our future operating results. Industry Background Effective management of human capital is a core capability for all organizations. Identifying, acquiring and retaining talent is a priority at all levels of an organization. Likewise, in today’s increasingly complex business and regulatory environment, organizations are being pressured to manage critical payroll and HCM functions more effectively, automate manual processes and decrease their operating costs, while at the same time successfully managing their workforces. Complex and Dynamic Tax and Regulatory Environment The tax and regulatory environment in the United States is complex and dynamic. Organizations are subject to a myriad of benefit, workers compensation, healthcare, tax and other rules, regulations and reporting obligations. In addition to U.S. federal taxing and regulatory authorities, there are more than 10,000 state and local tax codes in the United States. Further, federal, state and local government agencies continually enact and amend the rules, regulations and reporting requirements with which organizations must comply.

Worldwide Coronavirus Pandemic (“COVID-19”) On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts ordered all businesses and organizations that do not provide “COVID-19 Essential Services” to close their physical workplaces and facilities to workers, customers and the public as of noon on March 24, 2020. At that time, we took the necessary steps to enable an all-remote workforce. Many of our clients worldwide were similarly impacted. Over time, the restrictions in the state of Massachusetts were eased, or re-tightened, in line with the trends of the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we were in a hybrid model with some employees coming into the office and others continuing to work remotely. The global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to evolve, and the extent to which COVID-19 may have long-term impact on our business and the markets we serve, will depend on future developments-which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the pace of ongoing vaccination efforts in the United States and the rest of the world, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing measures in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. We are continuing to monitor the situation with our primary focus on the health and safety of our employees and clients.

Our Mandiant solutions include our controls-agnostic threat intelligence, validation, and XDR SaaS solutions, as well as our portfolio of managed services and consulting services. We are developing the Mandiant Advantage platform to be a single portal for customers to access all Mandiant solutions. In January 2020, we acquired Cloudvisory LLC, a provider of cloud visibility and control solutions. In November 2020, we acquired Respond Software, Inc., a cybersecurity investigation automation company. In December 2020, we issued and sold 400,000 shares of a newly designated 4.5% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a price of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $400.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,900 end-customers, including more than 50% of the Forbes Global 2000. Our customers include leading enterprises in a diverse set of industries, including telecommunications, technology, financial services, public utilities, healthcare and oil and gas, as well as leading U.S. and international governmental agencies.

Impact of COVID-19 on our Business In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic. We operate in geographic locations that have been impacted by COVID-19. The pandemic has impacted, and could further impact, our operations and the operations of our customers as a result of quarantines, various local, state and federal government public health orders, facility and business closures, and travel and logistics restrictions. While we instituted a global work-from-home policy and restricted employee travel to essential, business-critical trips toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, we were able to maintain strong customer relationships and deliver our technology-enabled managed and professional services to customers without interruption. As a result, we did not incur significant disruptions to our operations during the year ended December 31, 2020. We anticipate governments and businesses will likely take additional actions or extend existing actions to respond to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Item 1. Business. Overview BigCommerce is leading a new era of ecommerce. Our software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform simplifies the creation of beautiful, engaging online stores by delivering a unique combination of ease-of-use, enterprise functionality, and flexibility. We power both our customers’ branded ecommerce stores and their cross-channel connections to popular online marketplaces, social networks, and offline point-of-sale (“POS”) systems. BigCommerce empowers businesses to turn digital transformation into a competitive advantage. We allow merchants to build their ecommerce solution their way with the freedom of choice that makes the most sense for their unique business and product offerings. We provide a comprehensive platform for launching and scaling an ecommerce operation, including store design, catalog management, hosting, checkout, order management, reporting, and pre-integrations into best of breed third-party services like payments, shipping and fulfillment, point of sale, marketing and accounting. We target the following business segments: ● small businesses (“SMBs”), which we define as sites with annual online sales less than $1 million, ● the mid-market, which we define as sites with annual online sales between $1 million and $50 million, and ● large enterprises, which we define as sites with annual online sales from $50 million to billions of dollars. We serve these segments with a platform offering enterprise-grade functionality, openness and performance capabilities with SMB friendly simplicity and ease-of-use. Our platform is the result of a multi- year investment in platform transformation. In nearly every component of our platform, we have added advanced functionality and openness using application programming interface (“API”) endpoints. We strive to provide the world’s best SaaS ecommerce platform for all customers and all stages of customer growth. Our platform serves customers across a wide variety of sizes, product categories, and purchase types, including business-to-consumer (“B2C”) and business-to-business (“B2B”). For the mid-market and large enterprise segments, we believe our platform combines three elements not typically offered together: • Multi-tenant SaaS. The speed, ease-of-use, high-performance, and continuously-updated benefits associated with multi-tenant SaaS. • Enterprise functionality. Enterprise-grade functionality capable of supporting sophisticated use cases and significant sales volumes. • Open SaaS. Platform-wide APIs that enable businesses to customize their sites and integrate with external applications and services. We believe this powerful combination makes ecommerce success at scale more economically and operationally achievable than ever before. We have become a leader in both branded-site and cross-channel commerce. Cross-channel commerce involves the integration of a customer’s commerce capabilities with other sites-online and offline-where consumers and businesses make their purchases. We offer free, direct integrations with leading social networks such as Facebook and Instagram, search engines such as Google, online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay, and POS platforms such as Square, Clover (a Fiserv company), and Vend. A dynamic and growing cross-channel category is “headless commerce,” which refers to the integration of a back-end commerce platform like ours with a front-end user experience separately created in a content management system (“CMS”) or design framework. The most dynamic and interactive online user experiences are often created using these tools. We integrate seamlessly with the leading CMSs, digital experience platforms, design frameworks, and custom front ends. Partners are essential to our open strategy. We believe we possess one of the deepest and broadest ecosystems of integrated technology solutions in the ecommerce industry. We strategically partner with, rather than compete against, the leading providers in adjacent categories, including payments, shipping, POS, CMS, customer relationship management (“CRM”), and enterprise resource planning (“ERP”). Our partner-centric strategy stands in contrast to our largest competitors, which operate complex software stacks that compete across categories. We focus our research and development investments in our core product to create a best-of-breed ecommerce platform. We believe this strategy has four advantages: • Core product focus. We can create the industry’s best ecommerce platform and innovate faster than our competition by focusing development on a single core product. • Best-of-breed choice. We offer our customers the choice of best-of-breed, tightly integrated solutions across verticals. • Cooperative marketing and sales. We co-market and co-sell with our strategic technology partners in each category. • High gross margins. We earn high-margin revenue share from a subset of our strategic technology partners, and this complements the high gross margin of our core ecommerce platform. Our business has achieved significant growth since our inception. We had total revenues of $152.4 million, $112.1 million and $91.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We plan to continue to invest in our “Open SaaS” strategy, building new partnerships and continuing to develop a platform that offers best-of-breed functionality with the cost-effectiveness of multi-tenant SaaS. As we work to develop and deliver this platform for our customers, we will also invest and grow our business by acquiring additional customers to our platform, growing our revenue with existing customers, and expanding our presence in new segments and geographies. We have invested, and intend to continue our disciplined investment strategy to grow our business by expanding our sales and marketing activities, including increasing the breadth and depth of our agency and technology partner ecosystem, enhancing our platform developments, and scaling our operations to support our existing and growing customer base. We incurred net losses of $37.6 million, $42.6 million and $38.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. Impact of COVID-19 COVID-19, declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has caused disruption to the economies and communities of the United States and our target international markets. In the interest of public health, many governments closed physical stores and places of business deemed non-essential. This precipitated a significant shift in shopping behavior from offline to online. Our business has benefitted from this shift, both in accelerated sales growth for our existing customers’ stores, and in our sales of new store subscriptions to customers. Nevertheless, we do not have certainty that those trends will continue; the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty it has created in the global economy could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

"ITEM 1.BUSINESS Overview Ideanomics, Inc. (“Ideanomics” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: IDEX) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 19, 2004. From 2010 through 2017, our primary business activities were providing premium content video on demand (“VOD”) services, with primary operations in the PRC, through our subsidiaries and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) under the brand name You-on-Demand (“YOD.”) We closed the YOD business during 2019. Starting in early 2017, the Company transitioned its business model to become a next-generation financial technology (“fintech”) company. The Company built a network of businesses, operating principally in the trading of petroleum products and electronic components that the Company believed had significant potential to recognize benefits from blockchain and artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies including enhancing operations, addressing cost inefficiencies, improving documentation and standardization, unlocking asset value and improving customer engagement. During 2018, the Company ceased operations in the petroleum products and electronic components trading businesses and disposed of the businesses during 2019. As we looked to deploy fintech solutions in late 2018 and into 2019, we identified a unique opportunity in the Chinese Electric Vehicle (“EV”) industry to facilitate large scale conversion of fleet vehicles from internal combustion engines to EV. This led us to establish our Mobile Energy Global (“MEG”) business unit. Fintech continues to be a sector of interest to us as we look to invest in and develop businesses that can improve the financial services industry, particularly as it relates to deploying blockchain and AI technologies. Principal Products or Services and Their Markets Overview Ideanomics Mobility Ideanomics Mobility is driving EV adoption by assembling a synergistic ecosystem of subsidiaries and investments across the 3 key pillars of EV: Vehicles, Charging, and Energy. These three pillars provide the foundation for Ideanomics Mobility’s planned offering of unique business solutions such as Charging as a Service (“CaaS”) and Vehicle as a Service (“VaaS.”) Each operating company within Ideanomics Mobility offers its own unique products and participates in a shared services ecosystem fulfilling Ideanomics’ Sales-to-Financing-to-Charging (“S2F2C”) model, with centralized supply chain operations and marketing expertise designed to accelerate growth and business opportunities across the group. The combination of products from within its subsidiaries and investments, coupled with Ideanomics Mobility’s shared services, will provide the Company with the opportunity to bring to market unique business solutions intended to drive commercial fleet electrification such as Charging-as-a-Service and Vehicle-as-a-Service. These solutions offer fleet operators an opportunity to benefit from an OpEx-driven model which lowers the barrier to entry for the adoption of zero emissions fleets. The Company believes that the EV market is poised for rapid growth. Bloomberg NEF estimates that global commercial EV sales will reach 1.2 million units in 2023. The global EV charging infrastructure market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 33.4% from 2021 to 2028 to $144.97 billion. President Biden’s administration is supportive of EV with a goal to achieve a 100% clean-energy economy and states such as California have accelerated timelines to phase out internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles. Ideanomics Mobility’s mission is to leverage its ecosystem of synergistic operating companies to generate efficiencies and increase business opportunities across the group. With a diverse commercial EV product offering, the company plans to use EV and EV battery sales and financing solutions to attract commercial fleet operators that will generate large scale demand for energy. The Company operates as an end-to-end solutions provider for the procurement, financing, charging and energy management needs for fleet operators of commercial EV. Ideanomics Mobility focuses on commercial EV rather than passenger personal EV, as commercial EV is on an accelerated adoption path when compared to consumer EV adoption - which is expected to take between ten to fifteen years. We focus on four distinct commercial vehicle types with supporting income streams: 1) Closed-area heavy commercial, in sectors such as Mining, Airports, and Sea Ports 2) Last-mile delivery light commercial 3) Buses and Coaches 4) Taxis. The vehicle financing solutions (such as purchase or leasing) would generate fee-based revenues whereas the charging and energy management would yield recurring revenue streams. Ideanomics Mobility’s revenues are generated from its S2F2C operating model. The Company’s planned EV revenues will come from the sale of EVs under our Medici Motor Works and Treeletrik brands outside of the China and within China through our MEG operating units sale of other manufacturers vehicles and batteries. The Company’s presence in the China market creates a deep knowledge of the logistics and supply chain for the manufacture of EVs, batteries and related components; this in turn enables the sourcing of high quality components at competitive prices for the Company’s operations outside of China. Within the Ideanomics Mobility business unit there are four operating companies: Mobile Energy Global (“MEG”) The Company’s MEG business operates in China where government clean air regulations and subsidy programs provide a strong impetus for the adoption of commercial EV. The Company competes in China using its S2F2C. Using this model the Company helps the customer find the best vehicle for its needs and earns fees for every completed sale; revenue is derived from the spread between group buying of vehicles and price sold, fees for the arrangement of financing, and payments from subsequent charging and energy management. Tree Technologies Sdn. Bhd. (“Tree Technologies”) Tree Technologies is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and through its Treeletrik brand sells EV bikes, scooters, and batteries throughout the ASEAN region. Two-wheel bikes and scooters form a large part of the transport infrastructure in the ASEAN region; according to Deloitte Consulting, there were 13.7 million motor bikes sold in the six major ASEAN countries in 2019. Environmental regulations in the ASEAN region help accelerate the adoption of EV bikes. The Company has also started to import Treeletrik brand EV bikes into the United States. Medici Motor Works Medici Motor Works plans to sell its own brand vehicles in the United States, Latin America and Europe.

Employees and contractors sign into BIO-key PortalGuard to seamlessly and securely access the applications of need to do their work, and customers sign into BIO-key PortalGuard to access online services. Organizations use PortalGuard to securely collaborate and communicate with their partners and to provide their customers with flexible, resilient user experiences online and while using mobile devices. BIO-key’s WEB-key is a scalable biometric service management platform, incorporating key functions for regulatory compliance, enrollment, authentication or identification, and integrity in a multi-tenant private or public cloud delivery platform. Government agencies use BIO-key for their large-scale civil ID projects, because WEB-key underpins a biometric identity ecosystem, is cloud-ready, and provides a scalable, high-integrity trust platform which can be operated anywhere and supports over 30 fingerprint scanners interchangeably. We also deliver biometric software integration application programming interfaces, or APIs, allowing software developers to leverage our platform to securely and efficiently embed biometric multi-factor authentication, or MFA, into their own products. This allows software developers to focus on their core functionality while BIO-key ensures users enter the application without requiring they carry their phone or any token. Even the most security-focused organizations are suffering breaches as a result of human error or improper conduct. As enterprises scale the number of software as a service, or SaaS applications, and multi-cloud services they rely on and the interconnections between them increase, assured identity has emerged as a critical component of an organization’s security framework, directly affecting each triad of cybersecurity - confidentiality, integrity, and availability. As access perimeters dissolve, organizations must evolve from network-based security models to Zero Trust and Continuous Authentication and Risk Trust Assessment (CARTA) security models, focusing on adaptive and context-aware controls. True server-secured biometric verification removes the human nature vulnerability at the root of many security compromises creating a more reliable means to manage user access and protect digital assets against rogue users willing to hand over their credentials to a proxy. Our global identity as a service, or IDaaS, hosting capability allows our customers to simplify and efficiently scale their security infrastructures across internal IT systems and external customer facing applications without installation overhead, security or uptime management efforts. We designed BIO-key PortalGuard IDaaS and WEB-key to provide organizations an integrated approach to managing and securing all of their identities using the technologies they already use while providing capacity for future needs through the strategic use of biometrics to limit vulnerability and contain authentication costs. Our platform allows users to authenticate their customers, employees, contractors, and partners.

"Item 1. Business Factors History The Company was formed in Delaware on June 5, 2006 as Caddystats, Inc. On March 3, 2009, the Company acquired all of the voting shares of Roadships Holdings, Inc., a Florida Corporation, and Roadships America, Inc., also a Florida Corporation in exchange for an aggregate of 16,025,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. On March 4, 2009, the Company changed its name to Roadships Holdings, Inc. On May 26, 2015, the Company acquired all the voting shares of Click Evidence Inc., an Arizona corporation. Effective November 2, 2015, the Company changed its name to Tautachrome Inc. Our Business Tautachrome operates in the internet applications space, a large business space we believe to be uniquely able to make possible fast growing and novel business. The iPhone, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber and numerous other examples are reminders of the ability of the internet applications business space to surprise us with new business universes “out of nowhere.” A recent arrival in the internet applications space is blockchain technology, a technology empowering entities to create ecosystems of trade based on self-introduced and globally useable secure trading currencies. Blockchain technology has added a significant element to Tautachrome’s business plans and activities. In addition, the subsequent development of a new patent pending technology dubbed ARknet technology that exploits augmented reality in a new solution to the purchasing interaction between global consumers and providers has been licensed by the Company for development. Tautachrome is currently pursuing three main avenues of business activity based on our patented activated imaging technology, our blockchain trading currency, and the ARknet patent pending technology (together banded “KlickZie” technology): 1. KlickZie ARknet technology business: Our licensed activity to develop and monetize a new augmented reality (“AR”) technology called “ARknet technology which permits goods and services providers to establish geolocated augmented reality interfaces, called ARks, allowing consumers to interact with inside info on the provider’s products, specials and discounts with live purchasing provided. A provider’s ARk may be located anywhere on earth, at a store location, or anywhere else the provider may desire. The ARknet is a fintech platform connecting consumers to providers in the global $48 trillion household purchasing market, using augmented reality as the medium of interaction. 2. KlickZie’s blockchain trading currency ecosystem: our recently added activity to create our own KlickZie blockchain and trading currency to incentivize consumer usage of the ARknet paltform, and 3. KlickZie Activated Digital Imagery business: our longstanding flagship activity to develop and monetize downloadable apps based on our patented KlickZie trusted imaging technology and based on our patented trusted image-based social interactions using the pictures and videos that smartphone users generate on the web using their KlickZie imaging app. 1. ARk Business Activity On October 17, 2018, the Company licensed and is now developing the ARknet technology, a Fintech patent pending technology aimed at the global household goods and services market. ARks are floating interactive pictures (ARk Symbols) only visible around you in the Augmented Reality view provided by the ARknet app using the camera imager in your smartphone. ARks are intended for goods and service providers as a way to draw attention to customers in the vicinity of a provider’s ARk Symbol. Shoppers and buyers seeing a Symbol can interact with the provider’s goods or services via the ARk Symbol. The picture above is a shopping mall scene, where two stores, Claire’s on your right, and rue 21 etc! on your left, are shown displaying interactive ARk symbols. Claire’s ARk is a “standard” ARk symbol, while rue 21 etc! uses a picture of their “etc. Gold” perfume product as their ARk symbol. Either way, using their smartphone imager an ARknet app users can touch the store’s ARk Symbol and on their smartphone access the provider’s Ark page containing interest-grabbing information, including pictures or videos of today’s specials, in-ARk purchase and checkout features, reviews, links, menus, social media profiles or anything else the store wants to advertise. Arks may be mobile ARks, using the app user’s mobile device to mobilize the ARk location, or stationary ARks, using a set geo location determined by coordinates or determined by fixing the ARk location by moving the ARk owner’s mobile device to a desired location and setting the stationary ARk’s location there. Providers may create their ARks, decide on their ARk Symbol, choose their Symbol geolocations and provide for license payment to the Company, using features in the ARk app. We intend the ARk app to be free to consumers and other users wishing to use the app to survey their environ for the presence of ARk symbols. We envision a KlickZie ARknet with billions of users and ARks connecting humanity, commerce, information, crypto currency, and innovation in useful ways. Plus, we want to return the ownership of users’ information and valuable items such as images and video, back to where it rightfully belongs, the individual user. For additional information, visit https://myarknet.io. 2. KlickZie blockchain trading currency In late 2017 we formed a development team of providers to develop a KlickZie blockchain (branded the “zChain”) to handle transactions using a cryptographically secured trading currency designated the “KLK” currency. The KLK is intended to be the currency of the imagery trading ecosystem allowing KlickZie users to monetize their pictures and videos and thereby enabling the ability to conduct widescale buying, selling and licensing of KlickZie pictures and videos. Our development team consists of individuals from the blockchain development company Kelecorix, Inc., and individuals from the image storage company Honeycomb Digital, LLC. The team has developed the software and architecture for the implementation of a simple KlickZie app that seeks to implement the ownership properties of KlickZie imaging. Like other blockchains, the zChain is intended to run in a decentralized manner. “Smart contracts” residing on the zChain would implement the buying, selling licensing and other trading features on the zChain. Such smart contracts would implement a commission on zChain transactions that involve participation by the Company to complete (for instance the certification of the validity of...","The Company was formed in Delaware on June 5, 2006 as Caddystats, Inc.

Background In this era of Smart Everything, we have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products, particularly mobile devices. The growth of the Internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create, store, and share information. At the same time, the increasing use of electronics in cars, buildings, appliances, and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of smart devices. Numerous software applications (apps) have been developed to expand the potential of these connected devices. The increasing impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning is driving an increase in the activity of new and existing chip and system design companies around the world. These developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries. It is now common for a single chip to combine many components (processor, communications, memory, custom logic, input/output) and embedded software into a single system-on-chip (SoC), necessitating highly complex chip designs. The most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors. Transistors are the basic building blocks for ICs, each of which may have features that are less than 1/1,000th the diameter of a human hair. These devices are manufactured using masks to direct beams of light onto a wafer of silicon. At such small dimensions, the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production, proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches. Designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems, such as multiple-patterning lithography and FinFET, or 3D transistors, which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production. The popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance, reduced size, and lower power consumption. Our customers, who design those products, are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative offerings in shorter timeframes and at lower prices. In other words, innovation in chip and system design often hinges on providing products “better,” “sooner,” and “cheaper” than competitors. The design of these chips and systems is extremely complex and necessitates state-of-the-art solutions. Over the past several years, market verticals including AI, 5G, automotive and cloud computing infrastructure have contributed to the ongoing demand for our products and services. A similar dynamic is at work in the software arena, whether the software is embedded on a chip or used in other applications. The pace of innovation often requires developers to deliver more secure, high-quality software, which can include millions of lines of code, in increasingly frequent release cycles. Bugs, defects, and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix. But, at a time when software is critical in many industries across a growing array of smart devices, it is crucial to have high-quality, secure code to ensure consumers’ privacy and safety. Our Role-As the Silicon to Software Partner Synopsys' Silicon to Software technologies and services are designed to help our customers-chip and system engineers and software developers-to speed time to market, achieve the highest quality of results, mitigate risk, and maximize profitability. Chip and system designers must determine how best to design, locate, and connect the building blocks of chips, and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and cost-effectively. This is a complex, multi-step process that is both expensive and time-consuming. Our wide range of products help at different steps in the overall design process, from the design of individual ICs to the design of larger systems.
